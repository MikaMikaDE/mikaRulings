You can Tribute this card; your opponent takes no battle damage this turn, also you Special Summon 1 \"Raidraptor\" Xyz Monster from your Extra Deck in Defense Position, but its effects are negated, also return it to the Extra Deck during the End Phase. You can only use this effect of \"Raidraptor - Last Strix\" once per turn."
