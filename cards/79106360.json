    "Tengu": "● Level 5+ monsters, and monsters that can't be summoned this way, are sent to the GY.\n● Extra Deck monsters and Tokens are not counted towards \"cards shuffled into the Main Deck\".\n● If this Set card is attacked and destroyed by battle, it doesn't shuffle itself.\n● If \"Vanity's Fiend\" or \"Dark Simorgh\" are applying, this effect still activates, as it is mandatory.\nThose cards will be shuffled into the Deck, and each player can still Special Summon face-down this way.",
    "Goat": "● It has been ruled that a player can shuffle the monsters being placed face-down on the field by the effect of “Cyber Jar”. Can the monsters being Special Summoned by the effect of “Morphing Jar #2” also be shuffled when placing them on the field? \nA: Yes, you can shuffle around the face-down monsters after you have completed resolving the effect of Morphing Jar #2. \n●  \n●Q: If “Morphing Jar #2” is flipped due to an attack, will it still return to the Deck if it is destroyed from battle? \nA: No. \n● \n●Q: With “Morphing Jar #2,” do you count the monsters that are Lv 5 or higher, or Special Summon only monsters like “Yata-Garasu,” and what happens to them? \nA: High level monsters or Special Summoned monsters (like Yata-Garasu) are discarded when contained in the cards picked up but they are counted as monsters. \n● \n●Q: “Cyber Jar's” ruling says that Toons, Ritual Monsters, etc. are added to your hand, and of course, so will spirit monsters. Is this the same for “Morphing Jar #2?” \nA: Special Summon monsters will be placed in the GY due to “Morphing Jar #2's” effect. \n● 12/07/03 \n●Q: If Player A has 4 Sheep Tokens and 1 “Archfiend Soldier” and attacks Player B’s face-down “Morphing Jar #2”, would player A have to get 5 monsters from the Deck, since he had 5 monsters on the field when “Morphing Jar #2” was flipped, or would it only be 1, since “Archfiend Soldier” is the only one to go back into the Deck? \nA: Morphing Jar #2 only counts the monsters that actually return to the deck. Since the Sheep Tokens are simply removed from the field and NOT returned to the deck, they do not count as monsters being shuffled into your deck. \n●Steve Okegawa, 02/18/04 \n●Q: If there are Monster Tokens on the field when “Morphing Jar #2” is flipped face-up, will they be counted with the monsters returning to the Deck? \nA: Monster Tokens will not count toward Morphing Jar #2's effect. If you returned 3 monsters to your Deck, you will reveal cards from the Top of your Deck until you reach 3 monsters. Any that are 4 Lv Stars or less would be Set, any 5+ Lv Star Monsters or monsters with Special Summon requirements (irregardless of thier Lv Stars) would be sent to the GY. A monster revealed that could not be Special Summoned by the effect of Morphing Jar #2 would count toward the total. So If I had 2 monsters return to my Deck and when revealing cards from my Deck I reveal a Jinzo and an Ojama Green,. The Jinzo goes to my GY and Ojama Green is Set. ",
