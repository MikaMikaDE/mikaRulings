So if you equip Axe of Despair to Gradius, the ATK of Gradius’ Option will also increase by 1000 points.\n●Equipping Axe of Despair to Gradius’ Option has no purpose. Activating Reinforcements targeting Gradius’ Option serves no purpose. Luminous Spark on the field will not change the ATK/DEF of Gradius’ Option. It always has the same ATK/DEF of the selected Gradius.\n●If the selected Gradius is Set, Gradius’ Option is destroyed.\n●If the selected Gradius is temporarily removed from play by the effect of Interdimensional Matter Transporter or Dimensionhole, Gradius’ Option is destroyed.\n●If Gradius’ Option is temporarily removed from play by the effect of Interdimensional Matter Transporter or Dimensionhole, when it returns to the field you must select a new Gradius. If there is no Gradius on the field, it is destroyed.\n●If you pick up Gradius’ Option by the effect of Cyber Jar you cannot Special Summon it, even if Gradius is also in the 5 cards you picked up. It is placed in your hand instead.\n●If you pick up Gradius’ Option by the effect of Morphing Jar #2 you cannot Special Summon it, and it is sent to the GY.\n●Q: “Gradius’s Option” vs. “Limiter Removal.” Would “Gradius’s Option”’s ATK double twice? \nA: No, “Gradius’s Option's” base ATK is always whatever “Gradius's” is ATK is at the same time.  12/11/03\n●Q: When equipping “Shooting Star Bow – Ceal” to “Gradius’s Option”, “Gradius’s Option” will have the ability to directly attack your opponent’s LP, but will not have its ATK reduced by 1000 from the ATK of the associated “Gradius”, correct? \nA: That is the way it works right now.  01/17/04 \n●Q: Can “Gradius’s Option” be the target for the effects of “Witch of the Black Forest”, “Sangan”, “Shining Angel”, or “Last Will”? \nA: You cannot search for a Gradius' Option with the effect of Sangan or Witch of the Black Forest. Gradius' Option cannot be Special Summoned by the effect of Shining Angel or Last Will.  ",
