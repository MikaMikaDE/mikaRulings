    "Goat": "\n●Q: How does “Limiter Removal” work?\nA: What “Limiter Removal” seems to do is freeze the ATK of a monster at a certain point, including all modifiers like Equip Spell Cards, into a new base attack, of sorts. If you add a new modifier afterwards, it works off the new base attack and the new modifier is NOT doubled. This also means that if a modifier from before the base attack is removed, then the base attack remains unchanged even though the modifier is gone. This would include Equip Spell cards, Field Spell Cards, and monster effects. \n●Example 1: “X-Head Cannon” is equipped with “Axe of Despair” (total ATK equals 2800) “Limiter Removal” activates and resolves. “X-Head Cannon's” ATK then becomes 5600. The “X-Head Cannon” attacks the opponent, who responds by activating “Mystical Space Typhoon.” They destroy “Axe of Despair.” The “X-Head Cannon's” ATK remains at 5600, even though “Axe of Despair” has been destroyed. \n●Example 2: The turn player has 4 Sheep Tokens from a “Scapegoat” they activated during their opponent's turn. They summon “Cannon Soldier” and then activate “United We Stand” and equip it to “Cannon Soldier:” 1400 + (800 X 5) = 5400 ATK “Limiter Removal” is activated and resolves. (5400 X 2= 10800 ATK) If “Mystical Space Typhoon” destroys “United We Stand,” the “Cannon Soldier's” ATK will remain at 10800. If “Cannon Soldier” were to tribute all 4 sheep tokens with its effect, the attack will remain at 10800. \n●Example 3: “X-Head Cannon” and “Z-Metal Tank” are both face-up on the turn player's side of the field. They activate “Limiter Removal” and attack with each monster. “X-Head Cannon” = 3600 ATK “Z-Metal Tank” = 3000 ATK During MP 2, the turn player uses “Z-Metal Tanks” effect and equips it to “X-Head Cannon:” “X-Head Cannon's” ATK = (1800 X 2) + 600 = 4200. The new modifier is not doubled. Keep in mind that an effect can still cause the machine to have its ATK be lowered. “Dark Jeroid” would still lower the “Limiter Removal’d” Machine's attack by 800, for example.
