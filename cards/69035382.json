You will need to offer monsters that total level stars equal to 1, as stated on “Relinquished.” “Contract with the Abyss” may be used to Ritual Summon any DARK attribute Ritual monster including: “Dark Master Zorc,” “Relinquished,” “The Masked Beast,” and “Hungry Burger.” \n●Q: “Contract with the Abyss” states in its text that the Lv Stars of the monsters being offered as a Tribute equal that of the Ritual Monster being Ritual Summoned. Can the total of Lv Stars being offered be higher than the Ritual Monster or must it be exactly equal? \nA: The total Lv Stars of the monster(s) offered as a Tribute for the Ritual Summon using Contract with the Abyss must equal the Lv Stars of the DARK Ritual Monster you are attempting to Ritual Summon. You cannot go above the Lv Stars of the DARK Ritual Monster. So if I want to Ritual Summon Dark Master - Zorc using Contract with Abyss, I must offer monsters whose total Lv Stars = 8. I cannot go above 8. I could offer two 4-Lv Star monsters and the total would equal 8. I could offer four 2-Lv Star monsters, because they would equal 8. I would not be able to offer a 5-Lv Star and a 4-Lv Star monster because their total Lv Stars would equal 9.",
