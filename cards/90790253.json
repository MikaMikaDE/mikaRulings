Little Winguard's text states, Once per turn during your End Phase, you can change the battle position of this card. This effect SPECIFICALLY gives you the ability to change the card's battle position. Now, the text of Giant Orc: This position cannot be changed until the end of your next turn. This merely tells us that its position is 'locked' until the effect ends at the end of the player's next turn. Its effect does not specifically say you can change the position at the end of the turn. You would need to do a manual position change, which is not possible during the End Phase. ",
