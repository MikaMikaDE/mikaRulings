    "Base": "1. \"Forbidden Chalice\" can only negate monster effects that activate on the field or are applied on the field.\\n2. Monster effects that activate in the GY, like \"Sangan\", are not negated by \"Forbidden Chalice\".\\n3. If \"Forbidden Chalice\" has been used on \"Exiled Force\", you can Tribute \"Exiled Force\" and send it to the GY, but since the effect was activated on the field, the effect of \"Exiled Force\" is negated. (Remember: You cannot Chain \"Forbidden Chalice\" to negate \"Exiled Force\", since \"Exiled Force\" has already been Tributed at that point, and is no longer a face-up monster on the field. Therefore it is an ineligible target.)\\n4. Because it modifies ATK, \"Forbidden Chalice\" can be activated in the Damage Step. But not during damage calculation or any point in the Damage Step after damage calculation.\\n5. If a monster like \"Fusilier Dragon, the Dual-Mode Beast\" is targeted with \"Forbidden Chalice\", it has 3200 ATK, then 2800 ATK after the End Phase.\\n6. The effect of \"Forbidden Chalice\" expires during the End Phase like any other effect. Normal rules of priority apply, and the turn player must resolve effects first in the case of dual passing.\\n7. If a monster like \"Submarineroid\" attacks directly, and \"Forbidden Chalice\" is activated during the Damage Step, resolve the attack. A replay does not occur."
