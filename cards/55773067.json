If the player wasn't paying attention and said nothing as the opponent progressed through their turn they cannot activate the Drop Off.   \n●Q: If I know my opponent has a face-down “Drop Off”, can I play “Mystical Space Typhoon” from my hand to destroy it before I draw a card? \nA: Drawing a card MUST be the first event to happen during the DP. You or your opponent can activate cards AFTER you draw a card (examples: Drop Off, Mystical Space Typhoon, etc.), but NOT before drawing a card. Steve Okegawa, 02/22/04",
