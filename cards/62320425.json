If this card is sent from the hand or Deck to the GY: You can activate this effect; each player sends the top 5 cards of their Deck to the GY (or their entire Deck, if less than 5), then, if \"Exchange of the Spirit\" is in your GY, you can send 5 more cards from the top of either player's Deck to the GY. You can only use each effect of \"Agido the Ancient Sentinel\" once per turn."
