    "Goat": "●Castle of Dark Illusions’s” effect will increase the ATK of Zombie monsters on the field by 200 per turn for each turn that “Castle of Dark Illusions” is face-up, for the duration of 4 turns on the SP. \n●If “Castle of Dark Illusions” leaves the field before the fourth SP, the ATK increase will stop increasing. Any ATK increase that occurred as a result of “Castle of Dark Illusions” will remain on the respective Zombie monsters as long as those Zombie remain face up on the field.\n●Q: How are increases to ATK/DEF applied through the effect of “Castle of Dark Illusions” and are those increases removed when “Castle of Dark Illusions” is removed from the field? \nA: Castle of Dark Illusions: When it is flipped, any face-up Zombie-type monsters increase their ATK/DEF by 200 points. Then as long as the Castle of Dark Illusions remains face-up on the field, during your SP the ATK/DEF of any face-up Zombie monsters increaes by 200 points. The effect will continue until your 4th SP following the activation of the flip-effect or the Castle of Dark Illusions is destroyed: whichever comes first. The increase to the ATK/DEF of the Zombie monsters remains as long as the affected Zombie is still face-up on the field. Castle of Dark Illusions does not need to remain face-up on the field for the increase(s) to remain. \n●Q: Would my face-up “Spirit Reaper” be destroyed if my “Castle of Dark Illusions” was flipped face-up and do Zombie monsters place on the field face-up after “Castle of Dark Illusions” is face-up receive the increase? \nA: “Castle of Dark Illusion's” effect is not a targetting effect. “Spirit Reaper” will not be destroyed by its effect. Any Zombies brought face-up on the field while “Castle of Dark Illusion's” effect is applying will get the increase. It does not matter if the Zombies were face-up on the field when “Castle of Dark Illusions” was flipped.",
