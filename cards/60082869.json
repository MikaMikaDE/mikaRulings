If your opponent chains a card to destroy the target of Dust Tornado, you cannot then Set a Spell/Trap Card because Dust Tornado did not destroy a Spell/Trap Card. If your opponent activates the card targeted by Dust Tornado it is not negated, but is still destroyed by Dust Tornado so you may Set 1 Spell/Trap Card.\n●Q: If I chain “Dust Tornado” to the activation of “Harpie’s Feather Duster” or “Heavy Storm,” will the card being Set by the effect of “Dust Tornado” be destroyed by “Harpie’s Feather Duster” or “Heavy Storm?” \nA: Yes it would because the setting of that card occurs during the resolution of “Dust Tornado's” effect. The new card would have the misfortune of being present when the “Heavy Storm” or “Harpie's Feather Duster” resolved.  ",
