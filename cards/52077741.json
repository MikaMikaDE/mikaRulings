So if he’s WIND and is attacked by Insect Soldiers of the Sky, their ATK is 2000 during Damage Calculation and Obnoxious Celtic Guard is not destroyed. Or if an 1800 monster attacks and you use Rush Recklessly to increase the ATK to 2500 during the Damage Step, Obnoxious Celtic Guardian is not destroyed.\n●Obnoxious Celtic Guard’s effect looks at current ATK, not original ATK. So a monster with 1000 original ATK equipped with Megamorph to make it 2000 ATK won't destroy Obnoxious Celtic Guard as a result of battle.\n●Obnoxious Celtic Guard isn’t destroyed by damage calculation but can be destroyed by monster effects like Ryu Kokki.\n●If Obnoxious Celtic Guard is attacked by Dark Ruler Ha Des, or another monster that negates a card’s effect after it destroys it, Obnoxious Celtic Guard is not destroyed (so its effect is not negated).\n●Obnoxious Celtic Guard’s effect works for a battle caused by Last Turn, so if it battles a monster with ATK 1900 or higher, neither is destroyed and the Duel is a draw.",
