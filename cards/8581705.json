The increase only lasts until the End Phase of that turn.\n●If the Infernalqueen Archfiend is removed from the field or turned face-down after the effect has resolved, the Archfiend that had its ATK boosted will retain that attack increase until the End Phase of the turn.\n●If an Archfiend that has received the ATK increase from the Infernalqueen Archfiend is turned face-down or removed from the field, the ATK increase is lost. \n●You do not have to select the same face-up Archfiend monster during every SP.\n●Q: Can the “Infernalqueen Archfiend” choose a new target to boost at each SP or must she pick one target and stay with it? \nA: You can choose a different Archfiend every SP.
