    "Tengu": "(1) Once per turn, while you control another Six Samurai monster with a different name, you can destroy 1 Set Spell or Trap Card. This monster cannot declare an attack during the turn this effect is used. (2) If this card would be destroyed, you can destroy another Six Samurai monster you control instead.\n●The (1) Ignition Effect activates & resolves on the field.\n●This effect targets a face-down Spell / Trap Card anywhere on the field.\n●You must control another face-up Six Samurai to activate & resolve this effect.\n●If your other Six Samurai is flipped face-down / leaves the field, the target is not destroyed.\n●If The Six Samurai - Yaichi is flipped face-down / leaves the field, the target is still destroyed.\n●If “Yaichi” attacks, is flipped face-down then flipped face-up, you cannot use its effect that turn.\n●If this effect is used and “Skill Drain” is activated later, “Yaichi” still cannot attack that turn.\n●The (2) Continuous Effect does not activate, it applies while the destruction occurs.\n●This effect does not target.\n●You cannot destroy a face-down Six Samurai monster instead.\n●You can apply this effect when an effect that destroys this card resolves (ex: Call of the Haunted).\n●Your other Six Samurai is considered destroyed by this effect, not by battle / card effect.\n●Example: If “Ring of Destruction” targets a “Six Samurai” monster, and you destroy a different “Six Samurai” monster instead, zero damage will be inflicted by “Ring of Destruction”.\n●You can apply this effect in Substep 4 - Damage Calculation. The “Six Samurai” that you destroy instead is sent to the GY in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step.\n●If multiple Six Samurai would be destroyed at once, you can destroy 1 other Six Samurai for each you wish to protect. You cannot only destroy 1 “Six Samurai” to protect all the others.\n●Example: If Mirror Force would destroy 2 of your Six Samurai monsters, you must destroy 2 Defense Position Six Samurai monsters to save those two\n●Example: If Mirror Force would destroy all your face-up Six Samurai monsters, you cannot destroy any of them as substitutes.\n●If you control 2 “Six Samurai” monsters, and 1 of them equipped with “Legendary Ebon Steed” would be destroyed, the effect of “Legendary Ebon Steed” must be used. You cannot choose to destroy another “Six Samurai” monster instead.",
