The Unfriendly Amazon and the Kiseitai would each then return to their respective owner's GYs. Kiseitai's effect would not activate as a result of no longer being on the field.   \n●Q: Can you Tribute “Lava Golem” to keep “The Unfriendly Amazon” on the field? \nA: Yes, they could Tribute the Lava Golem for the effect of The Unfriendly Amazon. The Lava Golem would no longer be on the field as a result of being Tributed, so its effect would not activate. ",
