Then, after that, 'Spirit Reaper' is destroyed by its effect.\n● 'Spirit Reaper' is destroyed by its own effect after a card that targets it resolves. If a Spell Card targets it, and the activation of that Spell Card is negated (such as with 'Magic Jammer'), then 'Spirit Reaper' isn't destroyed. However, if the effect of the Spell Card was negated, such as if 'Imperial Order' is applying, then 'Spirit Reaper' is destroyed because the Spell Card resolves (even though its effect is negated). Even if 'Imperial Order' is already applying, you can activate a card such as 'Tribute to the Doomed' designating 'Spirit Reaper', and 'Spirit Reaper' will be destroyed by its own effect.\n● If “Spirit Reaper” is targeted by an Equip Spell Card, and an effect like “Dust Tornado” is chained to destroy the Equip Spell Card before it resolves, “Spirit Reaper” is still destroyed because the activation of the Equip Spell Card was not negated, even though the effect of the Equip Spell Card isn't applied. (If “Magic Jammer” or “Riryoku Field” was used instead, then “Spirit Reaper” would not be destroyed because both of those Trap Cards would negate the Equip Spell Card’s activation.)\n● 'Spirit Reaper' is only destroyed by its own effect if it is applying when the effect designating it as a target activates, AND after the effect designating it as a target resolves. If you Special Summon 'Spirit Reaper' with Monster Reborn, or flip it face-down with 'Book of Moon', or flip it face-up with 'Book of Taiyou', it isn't destroyed. If a face-down 'Spirit Reaper' is targeted with 'Change of Heart', then Flip Summoned, it isn't destroyed because it was face-down when 'Change of Heart' was activated. If 'Spirit Reaper' is targeted by the effect of 'Relinquished', 'Spirit Reaper' is an Equip Spell Card after the effect of 'Relinquished' resolves, so it isn't destroyed. If 'Spirit Reaper' is removed from play with 'Dimensionhole' or 'Interdimensional Matter Transporter' or 'Different Dimension Gate', then it is removed from play so it isn't destroyed. If 'Spirit Reaper' is shuffled into the Deck with 'Monster Recovery', it’s not destroyed. If 'Spirit Reaper' is returned to the hand with 'Penguin Soldier', it’s not destroyed.\n● You can't activate “Snatch Steal” or “Change of Heart” and target “Spirit Reaper” if you do not have an empty Monster Card Zone. (Even though the “Spirit Reaper” would be destroyed before switching sides).\n● If 'Spirit Reaper' is destroyed by its effect during the Damage Step, such as if 'Rush Recklessly' was activated to increase its ATK, destroy 'Spirit Reaper' with its effect AFTER damage calculation.\n● 'Spirit Reaper' is destroyed if equipped, includingwith 'Heart of Clear Water'.\n● Examples of cards that will not destroy 'Spirit Reaper' because they do not target: 'Creature Swap', 'Adhesion Trap Hole', 'Spear Dragon'.\n● Vs. 'Soul Exchange': Since 'Soul Exchange' targets, 'Spirit Reaper' is destroyed by its own effect before you can Tribute it.\n● 'Spirit Reaper' has a special effect for when it isn’t destroyed (as a result of battle), and a special effect for an extra reason to destroy it (when targeted by an effect). But it can still be destroyed by all other normal effects that would destroy a monster: 'Cyber Jar', 'Raigeki', etc.\n● If 'Spirit Reaper' is Special Summoned with 'Premature Burial' or 'Call of the Haunted', 'Spirit Reaper' is destroyed after it is Special Summoned because it is targeted by an effect.\n● 'Spirit Reaper' only forces your opponent to discard when 'Spirit Reaper' attacks directly (such as when your opponent has no monsters on the field), AND when it inflicts at least 1 point of damage to the opponent’s LP. So if your opponent uses 'Kuriboh', 'Waboku', or 'Tornado Wall' to prevent the damage, 'Spirit Reaper' does not force the opponent to discard.\n● 'Dreamsprite' targets 1 of your own monsters. If 'Spirit Reaper' is targeted, it is destroyed after damage calculation.\n● 'Patrician of Darkness' does not target, so 'Spirit Reaper' isn't destroyed if you use 'Patrician of Darkness' to force your opponent to attack it.\n● If 'Spirit Reaper' is targeted by 'Riryoku', it is destroyed, but the increase to the other monster’s ATK lasts until the end of the turn as normal.\n● If a Spellcaster affected by 'Diffusion Wave-Motion' attacks 'Spirit Reaper', it’s just a normal attack. 'Spirit Reaper' isn't being targeted by 'Diffusion Wave-Motion'.\n● If 'Skill Drain' is applying, 'Spirit Reaper' can be equiped with Equip Cards, but if 'Skill Drain' is later removed from the field 'Spirit Reaper' wil be destroyed.\n● 'Spirit Reaper' can be destroyed as a result of battle while 'Skill Drain' is applying.",
