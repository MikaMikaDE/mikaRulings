It cannot be applied for effects that remove a Spell Counter (e.g. \"Mythical Beast Cerberus\").\n● If your card with an effect that removes Spell Counters for cost has no Spell Counters on it (e.g. \"Breaker the Magical Warrior\"), you can still activate the effect, removing a Spell Counter from this card.\n\nAbout the ④ effect:\n● This effect can only be applied if this card would be destroyed by card effect. It cannot be applied if your opponent activates a Field Spell.",
