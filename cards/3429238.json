If you control your opponent's \"Drill Warrior\" and remove it from play, it will be Special Summoned to its owner's side of the field during the owner's next Standby Phase and they will add a Monster Card to their hand.\\n4. Special Summoning \"Drill Warrior\" and adding 1 Monster Card to your hand do not happen at the same time. You Special Summon, then add the Monster Card to your hand. \"Bottomless Trap Hole\" cannot be activated.\\n5. You do not target the Monster Card you return to your hand.\\n6.
