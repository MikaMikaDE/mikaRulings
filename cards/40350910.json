So in my turn I activate Timidity. It resolves properly. I Set 1 card in my S/T Zone. I end my turn. My opponent's turn begins. Until their End Phase, any Set Spell/Trap Cards cannot be destroyed. During my opponent's End Phase they could activate a Mystical Space Typhoon and target my face-down card in my Spell/Trap Card Zone, and it could be destroyed. ",
