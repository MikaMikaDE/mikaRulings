(2) If this card would be destroyed, you can destroy another Six Samurai monster you control instead.\n●The (1) mandatory Trigger Effect activates & resolves on the field.\n●This effect activates in  Substep 1 - Start of the Damage Step, before the Set monster if revealed.\n●This effect only activates if you control another Six Samurai monster with a different name.\n●The (2) Continuous Effect does not activate, it applies while the destruction occurs.\n●This effect does not target.\n●You cannot destroy a face-down Six Samurai monster instead.\n●You can apply this effect when an effect that destroys this card resolves (ex: Call of the Haunted).\n●Your other Six Samurai is considered destroyed by this effect, not by battle / card effect.\n●Example: If “Ring of Destruction” targets a “Six Samurai” monster, and you destroy a different “Six Samurai” monster instead, zero damage will be inflicted by “Ring of Destruction”.\n●You can apply this effect in Substep 4 - Damage Calculation. The “Six Samurai” that you destroy instead is sent to the GY in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step.\n●If multiple Six Samurai would be destroyed at once, you can destroy 1 other Six Samurai for each you wish to protect. You cannot only destroy 1 “Six Samurai” to protect all the others.\n●Example: If Mirror Force would destroy 2 of your Six Samurai monsters, you must destroy 2 Defense Position Six Samurai monsters to save those two\n●Example: If Mirror Force would destroy all your face-up Six Samurai monsters, you cannot destroy any of them as substitutes.\n●If you control 2 “Six Samurai” monsters, and 1 of them equipped with “Legendary Ebon Steed” would be destroyed, the effect of “Legendary Ebon Steed” must be used. You cannot choose to destroy another “Six Samurai” monster instead.",

You can apply this effect while resolving an effect that would destroy the monster.\n● This effect does not target.\n● This effect can be used during the Damage Step. If you destroy a “Six Samurai” to save another “Six Samurai” that would have been destroyed by battle, you do so during damage calculation. The “Six Samurai” that you destroyed instead is sent to the GY at the same time that monsters destroyed by battle are sent to the GY.\n● You can't destroy a face-down “Six Samurai” monster instead.\n● You can't destroy a “Six Samurai” monster to save more than one other “Six Samurai” monster at the same time. Example: You control “Yariza” in Defense Position and “Nisashi” and “Irou” in Attack Position. “Mirror Force” is activated when you attack with “Nisashi”. You can destroy “Yariza” to save “Nisashi”, or destroy “Yariza” to save “Irou”. You can't destroy “Yariza” to save both “Nisashi” and “Irou” at the same time.\n● A “Six Samurai” monster that is in the process of being destroyed can't be destroyed to save another “Six Samurai” monster. For example, if you control “Yariza”, “Nisashi”, and “Irou” all in Attack Position, and your opponent activates “Mirror Force”, you can't destroy any of those 3 instead of another.\n● You can use the effect of “Six Samurai” monsters to prevent them from being destroyed by the effects of “Call of the Haunted” or “Premature Burial”. So if a “Six Samurai” (or “Great Shogun Shien”) is targeted by “Call of the Haunted”, and “Call of the Haunted” is destroyed, you can destroy a different “Six Samurai” monster instead of the one that was targeted by “Call of the Haunted”.\n● If “Ring of Destruction” targets a “Six Samurai” monster, and you destroy a different “Six Samurai” monster instead, zero damage will be inflicted by “Ring of Destruction”.\n● A “Six Samurai” monster destroyed by this effect is considered to be destroyed by the effect, no matter how the other “Six Samurai” monster would have been destroyed. \n● If you control 2 “Six Samurai” monsters, and 1 of them equipped with “Legendary Ebon Steed” would be destroyed, the effect of “Legendary Ebon Steed” must be used.
