If this card is no longer face-up on the field when the effect to negate a Spell/Trap Card resolves, the Spell/Trap Card is still negated.\\n4. If this card is attacked while face-down and would be destroyed by the battle, you can destroy another face-up 'Six Samurai' monster you control instead.\\n5. [FORUM] The effect of \"Legendary Six Samurai - Shi En\" can only be activated once per turn. Switching control of \"Legendary Six Samurai - Shi En\" from one player to another will not change the fact that the effect of this face-up monster has already been activated.\\n6. [FORUM] \"Legendary Six Samurai - Shi En\" cannot destroy another 'Six Samurai' monster that is also marked for destruction to save itself.\\n\\nEXAMPLE 1: Player A controls \"Legendary Six Samurai - Shi En\" and 2 other 'Six Samurai' monsters. Player B plays \"Dark Hole\". Player A would not be able to destroy one of the other 2 'Six Samurai' monsters he controls instead of \"Legendary Six Samurai - Shi En\" since all monsters are marked for destruction.\\n\\nEXAMPLE 2: Player A controls \"Legendary Six Samurai - Shi En\" and summons another 'Six Samurai' monster. Player B responds to the Summon with \"Torrential Tribute\". Player A would not be able to destroy the other 'Six Samurai' monster he Summoned instead of \"Legendary Six Samurai - Shi En\" since all monsters are marked for destruction."
