    "Goat": "●If Different Dimension Capsule is destroyed with Heavy Storm, etc., the card removed from play remains removed from play for the rest of the Duel.\n●If Imperial Order is activated, count the Standby Phases normally for Different Dimension Capsule. If Imperial Order is applying during the 2nd SP, you cannot add the removed card to your hand and Different Dimension Capsule stays on the field meaninglessly, and the removed card remains removed from play for the rest of the Duel.\n●If Imperial Order is chained to the activation of Different Dimension Capsule, then the effect of selecting a card from your Deck disappears and Different Dimension Capsule is destroyed.\n●Q: Can another card effect be used to retrieve the card that was removed from play by “Different Dimension Capsule”? \nA: If it is a monster you could use “Miracle Dig” on it, but you would need to have enough monsters already removed from play for “Miracle Dig” to be legal to activate. If it is a Spell/Trap card there are no cards at this time that would retreive it. The Spell/Trap card would remain removed from play until the next Duel. \n●Q: If “Different Dimension Capsule” is destroyed or returned to the Deck by an effect like “Fiber Jar”, will the card removed from play return to the controller’s hand at the second SP? \nA: Different Dimension Capsule must remain on the field until the second SP in order for its effect to resolve and plave the selected card into the player's hand. If Different Dimension Capsule is destroyed or removed from the field before the second SP, the selected card will remain removed from play. If the effect of the Different Dimension Capsule is negated during the second SP, the selected card will remain removed from play and the Different Dimension Capsule will remain on the field meaninglessly.",
