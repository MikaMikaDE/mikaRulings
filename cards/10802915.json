Its effect is negated, since its effect was activated on the field.\n\nIf a monster summoned this way becomes flipped face-down or leaves the field, its effects are no longer negated, starting from the moment it leaves the field.\nEG: ＂Sangan＂ summoned this way is destroyed by battle. Its effect is not negated, since its effect was not activated on the field.\nEG: ＂Night Assailant＂ summoned this way becomes Set by Book of Moon. Its effect when flipped face-up is not negated, since the negation stopped applying once it became Set.",
