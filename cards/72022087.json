You can target Tokens, Fusion Monsters, and Synchro Monsters with this card too. Tokens will simply disappear, and Fusions and Synchro Monsters will return to the Extra Deck.\\n4. You can activate this card when your opponent's monster that you control is destroyed by battle and sent to their GY.\\n5. If one of the targets is no longer face-up on the field when this card resolves, you still return the remaining target.\\n6. If you Chain this card to the effect of \"Rescueroid\" to return \"Rescueroid\" to the Deck, the effect of \"Rescueroid\" will not be applied.\\n7. If a monster attacks and destroys your \"Exploder Dragon\" and sends it to the GY, and you Chain \"Liberty at Last!\" to return that monster to the Deck, it will return to the Deck and not be destroyed by the effect of \"Exploder Dragon\"."
