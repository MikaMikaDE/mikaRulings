You can't activate Serial Spell if it is the only card in your hand, or if it is Set and you have no cards in your hand.\n●Serial Spell only copies the effects of your Normal Spell Card, not any costs of that Spell Card. So if you chain Serial Spell to Delinquent Duo you don't pay an additional 1000 Life Points.\n●If you activate Monster Reborn, and chain Serial Spell, discarding your entire hand, you can select and revive one of the monsters you discarded for the cost of Serial Spell to be the monster that Serial Spell Special Summons to the field. (For example, if you target Dark Magician with Monster Reborn, then chain Serial Spell and discard Buster Blader, you can use Serial Spell to Special Summon the Buster Blader you discarded to activate Serial Spell.)\n●You can't level up Horus the Black Flame Dragon from 4 to 8 with just Level Up! and Serial Spell.

This is because it is a Quick-Play Spell Card and is sent to the GY after the chain resolves.\n●If you chain Serial Spell to Different Dimension Capsule it will copy the effect and remove 1 card you select in your Deck from play, face-down. But because Serial Spell does not remain on the field, the selected card remains removed from play face-down and is not placed in your hand.\n●You can activate Serial Spell to copy the effect of a Normal Spell Card, even if it is Raigeki or Soul Exchange and copying the effect serves no real purpose.\n●If you have 2 monsters in your GY, and your opponent only has 1 monster in their GY, you can activate The Shallow Grave and chain Serial Spell, even though you would not normally be able to activate a second The Shallow Grave because your monster would no longer have any monsters in the GY. As a result, you will Special Summon 2 monsters and your opponent will only Special Summon 1 monster.\n●If you chain Serial Spell to Bait Doll, the entire effect of Bait Doll is applied and Serial Spell is also shuffled back into your Deck.\n●If you chain Serial Spell to Dragged Down into the Grave, the player who activated Serial Spell has no cards in hand, so the effect of Dragged Down into the Grave is impossible to resolve, and the effect disappears.\n●If you chain Serial Spell to Metamorphosis, there is no effect because you did not Tribute a monster for a cost, so Serial Spell has no point of reference and can't resolve.\n●If you chain Serial Spell to Monster Gate resolve the effect of Monster Gate twice (once for Serial Spell and once for Monster Gate) even though you only pay the cost once (for Monster Gate).",

Because you would send 'LV4' to the GY for 'LV Up!', but even if you copy it with 'Serial Spell', the first 'LV Up!' hasn't resolved, so 'LV6' isn't on the field to send to the GY as a cost for the copy of 'LV Up!' If you have 'Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV4' and 'Armed Dragon LV3' on the field, and send one of them to the GY with 'LV Up!', you can't use 'Serial Spell' to LV Up the other monster, since there was no monster sent to the GY as a cost for 'Serial Spell', and 'Serial Spell' would have no point of reference to resolve its effect.\n● If you chain 'Serial Spell' to 'Swords of Revealing Light' it will copy the effect of flipping all monsters face-up, but it will not remain on the field and prevent the opponent from attacking. This is because it is a Quick-Play Spell Card and is sent to the GY after the chain resolves.\n● If you chain 'Serial Spell' to 'Different Dimension Capsule' it will copy the effect and remove 1 card you select in your Deck from play, face-down. But because 'Serial Spell' does not remain on the field, the selected card remains removed from play face-down and isn't placed in your hand.\n● You can activate 'Serial Spell' to copy the effect of a Normal Spell Card, even if it is 'Raigeki' or 'Soul Exchange' and copying the effect serves no real purpose.\n● If you have 2 monsters in your GY, and your opponent only has 1 monster in their GY, you can activate 'The Shallow Grave' and chain 'Serial Spell', even though you would not normally be able to activate a second 'The Shallow Grave' because your monster would no longer have any monsters in the GY. As a result, you will Special Summon 2 monsters and your opponent will only Special Summon 1 monster.\n● If you chain 'Serial Spell' to 'Bait Doll', the entire effect of 'Bait Doll' is applied and 'Serial Spell' is also shuffled back into your Deck. \n● If you chain 'Serial Spell' to 'Dragged Down into the Grave', the player who activated 'Serial Spell' has no cards in hand, so the effect of 'Dragged Down into the Grave' is impossible to resolve, and the effect disappears. \n● If you chain 'Serial Spell' to 'Metamorphosis', there is no effect because you did not Tribute a monster for a cost, so 'Serial Spell' has no point of reference and can't resolve. \n● If you chain 'Serial Spell' to 'Monster Gate' resolve the effect of 'Monster Gate' twice (once for 'Serial Spell' and once for 'Monster Gate') even though you only pay the cost once (for 'Monster Gate').",
