It will not affect monsters summoned afterward.\n● Flip effects will not activate.\nEffects that trigger upon the card being flipped face-up will activate (e.g. \"Snowman Eater\" / \"Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo\")\n\nAbout the ② effect:\n● It does not target.\n● It activates in the End Step of the battle phase, the same timing as the tag out effect of \"Gladiator Beast\" monsters. The controller of multiple phase-dependent trigger effects can decide the order they want to activate them\n● \"My Body as a Shield\" and the effect of \"Stardust Dragon\" can be chained to this effect.\n\"Starlight Road\" can be chained to this effect if 2 or more monsters you control would be destroyed.\n● If a monster's attack was negated (e.g. by \"Battle Fader\" or \"Scrap-Iron Scarecrow\"), it will not be destroyed by this effect.\n● If a monster's attack is stopped (e.g. by \"Book of Moon\" or \"Enemy Controller\"), it will be destroyed by this effect (even if it is face-down)",

    "Base": "1. The effect to change Defense Position monsters to face-up Attack Position happens when \"Ancient Forest\" resolves.\\n2. If \"Mystical Space Typhoon\" is Chained to the activation of \"Ancient Forest\", the Defense Position monsters are not changed to Attack Position because \"Ancient Forest\" is no longer face-up on the field.\\n3. If a player controls both \"Ancient Forest\" and a 'Gladiator Beast' monster that has attacked, at the end of the Battle Phase he can choose which effect to activate and resolve first.\\n4. If \"Sasuke Samurai\" attacks a face-down monster and destroys it with its effect, it will still be destroyed at the end of the Battle Phase.\\n5. If a monster's attack is negated by \"Magic Cylinder\" it will not be destroyed at the end of the Battle Phase.\\n6. If a monster attacks and is removed from the field or ceases to be a monster before the end of the Battle Phase, it will not be destroyed.\\n7. If a monster attacks while \"Ancient Forest\" is being negated, but before the end of the Battle Phase the effect negating \"Ancient Forest\" disappears, the monster that attacked will be destroyed.\\n8. If a monster attacks and is flipped face-down by \"Book of Moon\" it will still be destroyed.\\n9. The effect of \"Ancient Forest\" will only destroy a monster during the turn it attacked.\\n10. The effect to destroy monsters starts a Chain.\\n11. If you activate \"Ancient Forest\" with the effect of \"Demise of the Land\" it will not change Defense Position monsters to face-up Attack Position.\\n12. \"Ancient Forest\" will not change a monster to face-up Attack Position if it was not on the field in Defense Position when \"Ancient Forest\" was activated."
