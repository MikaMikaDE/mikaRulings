(Can I attack directly still even though they have more than one?). \nA: Having 2 Guardian Kay'est is no different from just 1. Whether your opponent has 1, 2, or 3 of them on the field, you are still able to attack directly. This is assuming that they have no other monsters on the field, of course. Steve Okegawa, 02/22/04 \n●Q: Is “Guardian Kay’est” a Special Summon monster? \nA: Guardian Kay'est is a Normal Summon monster. You can only Normal Summon, Flip-Summon, or Special Summon Guardian Kay'est when you control a Rod of Silence - Kay'est face-up on your side of the field. You can Special Summon Guardian Kay'est from your GY while Rod of Silence - Kay'est is face-up on your side of the field. (Using Monster Reborn, Call of the Haunted, etc.)  \n●Q: If my opponent attacks one of my monsters, can I activate “Staunch Defender” and choose “Guardian Kay’est?” \nA: Guardian Kay'est would not be a valid target for Staunch Defender because your opponent cannot attack Guardian Kay'est. This is due to the effect of Guardian Kay'est.  ",

    "Base": "1. \"Guardian Kay'est\" is not affected by Spell Cards, just like \"The Legendary Fisherman\".\\n2. Your opponent cannot select \"Guardian Kay'est\" as the target of an attack.\\n3. If \"Guardian Kay'est\" is your only monster on the field, your opponent can attack your Life Points directly.\\n4. As long as \"Guardian Kay'est\" cannot be selected as the target of an attack, it cannot be targeted by the effect of \"Staunch Defender\", either.\\n5.

GUARDIANS: \"Guardian Baou\", \"Guardian Ceal\", \"Guardian Elma\", \"Guardian Grarl\", \"Guardian Kay'est\", and \"Guardian Tryce\" all share some basic rules. Using \"Guardian Elma\" as an example:\\n\\nYou can Set \"Guardian Elma\" face-down without \"Butterfly Dagger - Elma\", but you cannot Special Summon her face-down with \"The Shallow Grave\", etc., unless you have \"Butterfly Dagger - Elma\" on your side of the field.\\n10. If your Set \"Guardian Elma\" is flipped face-up with \"Swords of Revealing Light\", or by an attack, without \"Butterfly Dagger - Elma\" on your side of the field, she remains on the field because she was not Summoned.\\n\\n\"Guardian Elma\" is a normally Summoned monster, not a Special Summon-only monster. So if Normal Summoned she counts as your 1 Summon for the turn.\\n\\nYou cannot use \"Monster Reborn\" on \"Guardian Elma\" if you do not have \"Butterfly Dagger - Elma\" on your side of the field.\\n\\nIf you activate \"Monster Reborn\" and target \"Guardian Elma\" while you have \"Butterfly Dagger - Elma\" on the field, and your opponent chains \"Mystical Space Typhoon\" to destroy \"Butterfly Dagger - Elma\", so that it is no longer on the field when \"Monster Reborn\" resolves, you cannot Special Summon \"Guardian Elma\" and the effect of \"Monster Reborn\" disappears.\\n\\nYou can Normal Summon, Flip Summon, or Special Summon \"Guardian Elma\" even if your \"Butterfly Dagger - Elma\" has its effect negated by \"Imperial Order\".\\n\\nIf \"Cyber Jar\" resolves and you pick up \"Guardian Elma\" without \"Butterfly Dagger - Elma\" on your side of the field, \"Guardian Elma\" is added to your hand.\\n\\nThese rules apply to all six of these monsters."
