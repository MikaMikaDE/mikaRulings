You can't target a monster that is removed from play face-down.\\n4. If you can't return both targets to the GY, you don't Summon a Synchro Monster.\\n5. This card does not Synchro Summon, so you cannot Special Summon the monster Summoned by this card later if it goes to the GY or is removed from play.\\n6. You return the targeted monsters to the GY, then Special Summon the Synchro Monster. These do not happen at the same time."
