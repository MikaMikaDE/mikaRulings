    "ReturnDAD": "● The first effect of “Ancient Lamp” is a Trigger Effect.\n● When your face-down Defense Position “Ancient Lamp” is attacked:1. Your opponent’s monster declares an attack.2. “Ancient Lamp” is flipped face-up during the Damage Step. At this time you decide if you would like to activate its effect.3. Select a monster on your opponent’s side of the field other than the attacking one. This monster can be face-up or face-down and in any battle position.4. Calculate damage between the target monster and the attacking monster. The opponent (who controls both monsters) will take any Battle Damage resulting from the attack. \n● The opponent can chain “Divine Wrath” to “Ancient Lamp’s” effect and destroy it.\n● If a face-down Flip Effect monster was chosen as the new attack target, its Flip Effect activates as normal.\n● The first effect of “Ancient Lamp” targets a monster on your opponent’s side of the field (except the attacking monster.) If “Lord of D.” is applying you can't select a Dragon as the attack target. If you can't target any of your opponent’s monsters with this effect, you can't activate the effect.\n● If you select a “Spirit Reaper” as the new attack target, the “Spirit Reaper” will be destroyed AFTER damage calculation (at the same time that Flip Effects are resolved).\n● The effect of “Ancient Lamp” changes the attack target, so “Ancient Lamp” isn't involved in Damage Calculation.\n● If a face-down Defense Position “Ancient Lamp” is attacked by “Sasuke Samurai” or “Mystic Swordsman LV2”, it will be destroyed before it is flipped face-up and its effect will not activate.\n● If “Skill Drain” is applying, the effects of “Ancient Lamp” will be negated. (Attacks will not be re-directed.)\n● If the attacking monster can do piercing Battle Damage (such as “Mad Sword Beast”, “Saber Beetle”, or if “Meteorain” was activated or “Dragon’s Rage” is applicable) and you use the effect of “Ancient Lamp” to have it attack your opponent’s Defense Position monster who’s DEF is lower than the attacker’s ATK, the Battle Damage will be dealt to the controller of “Ancient Lamp”. This is because the text of the attacking monster says “inflict the difference as Battle Damage to the opponent’s LP.” \n● You can target a “Command Knight”, “Guardian Kay’est” or “The Legendary Fisherman” with “Umi” on the field with “Ancient Lamp’s” effect. You can target the opponent’s “Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower” even if they control another face-up Zombie.\n● If your opponent attacks your face-down Defense Position “Ancient Lamp” and you activate its effect and select the opponent’s face-down Defense Position “Ancient Lamp”, the 2nd “Lamp’s” effect will NOT activate. It must be attacked by an opponent’s monster.\n● If you use the effect of “Ancient Lamp” to make the opponent’s “Steamroid” attack or be attacked by their own monster, “Steamroid’s” ATK will not change because it isn't in battle with an opponent’s monster.\n● If you use the effect of “Ancient Lamp” to make the opponent’s “Don Zaloog” or “The Bistro Butcher” attack your opponent’s own monster, the effect of “Don Zaloog” or “The Bistro Butcher” will not activate because they are not doing battle damage to the opponent’s LP.\n● If your face-down Defense Position “Ancient Lamp” is attacked by “Dark Ruler Ha Des”, its effect activates. If you select an opponent’s effect monster as the new attack target, and it’s destroyed by “Dark Ruler Ha Des”, its effect will be negated.\n● If “D. D. Warrior” attacks a face-down Defense Position “Ancient Lamp” and its attack is re-directed by “Ancient Lamp’s” effect, the “D. D. Warrior” and the targeted monster will be removed from play. “Ancient Lamp” remains on the field.\n● If you select “Sanga of the Thunder” as the new attack target, the opponent can't activate its effect because his own monster is attacking “Sanga of the Thunder”; his opponent’s monster isn’t attacking.\n● If you use the effect of “Ancient Lamp” to select a Defense Position monster (whose DEF is higher than the ATK of the attacking monster) as the new attack target, you can still activate “Destruction Punch” or “Cross Counter” since your opponent controls the attacking monster. \n● If you use the effect of “Ancient Lamp” to select a face-down “Adhesive Explosive” as the new attack target, the effect of “Adhesive Exposive” will not activate because it isn't being attacked by an opponent’s monster.\n● If you use the effect of “Ancient Lamp” to have the opponent’s “Dark Necrofear” attack a stronger monster on their side of the field, “Dark Necrofear’s” effect will not activate since it was not destroyed by an opponent’s (your) monster.\n● If you use the effect of “Ancient Lamp” to have your opponent’s “Shadowknight Archfiend” attack their Attack Position “Sinister Serpent”, they will take 1700 points of Battle Damage. The damage isn't halved because it isn't being dealt to the opponent’s (your) LP.\n● If you use the effect of “Ancient Lamp” to have the opponent’s “Legacy Hunter” attack an opponent’s face-down Defense Position monster, and destroy it, “Legacy Hunter’s” effect will activate and you (the controller of “Ancient Lamp”) will shuffle a card from your hand into your Deck.\n● Special Summoning “La Jinn the Mystical Genie of the Lamp” from your hand is an Ignition Effect. It can be chained to.\n● You can only Special Summon 1 “La Jinn the Mystical Genie of the Lamp” at a time, but you can activate this effect multiple times during the same turn. So you could activate it 3 times and Special Summon 3 “La Jinn the Mystical Genie of the Lamp”.",
