However, as “Dark Spirit of the Silent” mentions nothing of the forced attack being special in any way, it does indeed count as that monster’s attack for the turn. Steve Okegawa, 03/21/04 \n●Q: If my opponent uses “Dark Spirit of the Silent” and forces my “Dark Elf” or “Jirai Gumo” to attack, do I still have to pay for the cost of attacking?\nA: Any monsters which have costs for attacking must be able to pay those costs, even when attacking due to the effect of “Dark Spirit of the Silent.” If the cost cannot be paid (Example: Only 800 LP left, “Dark Elf” is the only other monster to select), then the monster cannot attack. Steve Okegawa, 03/21/04\n●Q: If a face-up “Spear Dragon” is forced to attack via the effect of “Dark Spirit of the Silent”, will that “Spear Dragon” switched into face-up Defense Position immediately following the forced attack?\nA: Yes, “Spear Dragon” will go into Defense Position after the attack, just as if it had attacked of its own accord.
