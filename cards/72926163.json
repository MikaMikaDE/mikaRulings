If you fuse 2 \"Elemental HERO Neos\" to Summon this card, it gains no ATK from its effect, even if one of them was \"Elemental HERO Neos Alius\" being treated as \"Elemental HERO Neos\" by its effect.\\n2. If you use \"Goddess with the Third Eye\" to substitute for \"Elemental HERO Neos\", this card does not gain half of the ATK of \"Goddess with the Third Eye\".\\n3. The ATK gained is based on the printed original ATK of the Warrior-Type monster used for the Fusion Summon.\\n4. If you use a Token or a Trap Card treated as a monster, you use the original ATK value of the Token or the original ATK set by the Trap.\\n5. If \"Skill Drain\" is used while \"Elemental HERO Neos Knight\" has gained ATK from its own effect, the ATK gain will disappear and will not return even if \"Skill Drain\" is destroyed If \"Elemental HERO Neos Knight\" is flipped face-down while it has gained ATK from its own effect, the ATK gain will disappear and will not return even if \"Elemental HERO Neos Knight\" is flipped face-up again."
