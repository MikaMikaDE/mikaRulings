If your opponent moves a card(s) out of either GY (except during the Damage Step): You can Special Summon from your Extra Deck, 1 \"Exosister\" Xyz Monster using this face-up card you control as material. (This is treated as an Xyz Summon.) You can only use each effect of \"Exosister Irene\" once per turn."
