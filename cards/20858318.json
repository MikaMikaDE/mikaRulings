In other words, since you CANNOT attack during the opponent's turn, you CANNOT use the effect of attacking directly. However, note that Dark Scorpion Combination CAN be activated during the opponent's turn. Of course, it'd be a waste, since your monsters cannot declare an attack unless you are in your own Battle Phase. Steve Okegawa, 01/31/04 \n●Q: If one of the ‘Dark Scorpion’ cards is equipped with “Rod of the Mind’s Eye” and “Dark Scorpion Combination” is activated, how much damage will the equipped monster do? \nA: The Dark Scorpion member equipped with “Rod of the Mind's Eye” would do 1000 points of Battle Damage instead.",
