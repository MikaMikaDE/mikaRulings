Will “Mirage Knight” increase its ATK when attacking “Gradius’s Option”? A: Great Maju Garzett's base attack is 0, as printed on the card. Gradius' Option would be treated as having a 0 base attack for the effect of Mirage Knight, so the Mirage Knight would gain no boost from attacking it.   \n●Q: When “Mirage Knight” is special summoned by “Dark Flare Knight's” effect, would one still be able to attack with “Mirage Knight” during that same turn? A: Yes, you may attack with the Special Summoned “Mirage Knight.”  \n●Q:  If “Mirage Knight” attacks directly, will it still be removed from play by its own effect? A: Attacking directly is still considered being in battle. So Mirage Knight would be removed from play. bishop 02/21/04 \n●Q: If “Mirage Knight” was involved in battle, can “Book of Moon” be activated to turn it face-down and prevent it from being removed from play during the End Phase? A: The Mirage Knight would remain Set and would not be removed from play.  \n●Q: If “Mirage Knight” was involved in battle, can “Dimensionhole” be activated to remove it from play until the next SP preventing the effect of being removed from play during the End Phase? A: The Mirage Knight would not be removed from play by its effect when returned to the field by Dimensionhole.   \n●Q: Is a condition placed on “Mirage Knight” during Damage Calculation were it must be removed during the End Phase even if “Skill Drain” is activated during MP 2? A: Mirage Knight would not be removed from play during the End Phase if its effect is being negated by Skill Drain.",
