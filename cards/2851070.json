D. Warrior Lady activates her effect, Reflect Bounder is not removed from play because it is already in the GY. \n●Q: Can the effect of “Reflect Bounder” be chained with “Barrel Behind the Door?” \nA: Yes, you can use “Barrel Behind the Door” against “Reflect Bounder.” \n●bishop  \n●Q: What would happen if “Dark Ruler Ha Des” attacked a “Reflect Bounder?” Would “Reflect Bounder” still get its effect? \nA: When “Reflect Bounder” is attacked by “Dark Ruler Ha Des” (or attacked when “Dark Ruler Ha Des” is on the field), FIRST, Effect Damage is inflicted by “Reflect Bounder” prior to the Damage Step, THEN, Damage Calculation is the applied, and “Reflect Bounder” is determined to be destroyed, BUT, because of “Dark Ruler Ha Des,” the rest of the effect (Then ... this card is destroyed) of Reflect Bounder is negated, SO, “Reflect Bounder” is not destroyed by its own effect, but by Battle Damage instead. The end result is that “Dark Ruler Ha Des'” controller takes 2450 damage, and “Reflect Bounder's” controller takes 750 damage, and “Reflect Bounder” is destroyed by battle. \n●  \n●Q: If “Reflect Bounder” is in Face Down Attack position through the effect of “Darkness Approaches” will its effect activate when it is attacked? \nA: Reflect Bounder's effect will activate after it is flipped face-up by the attack. Reflect Bounder is flipped face-up before damage calculation. That is why its effect will activate. \n● \n●Q: If the opponent declares an attack on “Reflect Bounder” while in Defense Position and the player activates “Final Attack Orders”, will the effect of “Reflect Bounder” activate? \nA: The effect of Reflect Bounder would activate. This is because it is changed to Attack Position by the effect of Final Attack Orders after being flipped by the attack. This all occurs before damage calculation. \n●  \n●Q: If a player attacks “Reflect Bounder” with “Injection Fairy Lily” and chooses to activate her effect, will the player take 400 or 3400 points of damage from the effect of “Reflect Bounder”? \nA: Reflect Bounder would do 400 damage from its effect. Then you would resolve damage calculation. When you resolve the damage calculation Injection Fairy Lily's effect could be activated, in which case the controller of Reflect Bounder would take 1700 points of Battle Damage. After resolving damage calculation Reflect Bounder is destroyed by its effect. ",
