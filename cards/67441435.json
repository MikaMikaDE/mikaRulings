If \"Glow-Up Bulb\" is not in your GY when its effect resolves, you still send the top card of your Deck to the GY but you don't Special Summon.\\n3. If you have no cards in your Deck when this effect resolves, you do not Special Summon.\\n4. [FORUM] If both players each have a copy of \"Glow-Up Bulb\" in their respective GYs, during their respective Main Phases, they can each activate the effect of their own \"Glow-Up Bulb\"."
