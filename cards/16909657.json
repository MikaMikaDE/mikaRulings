    "Base": "1. This is a Trigger Effect. It does not target.\\n2. If you Summon a monster like \"Exiled Force\" that has an effect that activates on the field and then activate its effect, it will still be negated. If you Summon a monster like \"Sangan\" with an effect that activates in the GY, it will not be negated.\\n3. This card looks at the ATK of the destroyed monster during damage calculation. If a monster with an original ATK of 0 is destroyed by battle with \"Reptilianne Scylla\" while its ATK is increased by another effect, you cannot Special Summon it. If a monster whose ATK is being reduced to 0 by an effect like \"Twin Swords of Flashing Light - Tryce\" is destroyed by battle with \"Reptilianne Scylla\" you can Special Summon it."
