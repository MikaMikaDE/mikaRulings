    "Base": "1. If a Zombie monster is Special Summoned by \"Call of the Haunted\" and would be destroyed because \"Call of the Haunted\" would be destroyed, you cannot send \"Pyramid of Wonders\" to the GY instead because 2 cards are being destroyed at the same time. If \"Call of the Haunted\" is returned to your hand or Deck instead, only the Special Summoned monster would be destroyed, so you can send \"Pyramid of Wonders\" to the GY instead.\\n2. You can only use the effect of \"Pyramid of Wonders\" if 1 face-up Zombie monster is the only card on the field that would be destroyed.\\n3. You can use the effect of \"Pyramid of Wonders\" when a face-down Zombie monster you control is flipped face-up by an attack and then destroyed.\\n4. If you have multiple \"Pyramid of Wonders\" the ATK boosts are cumulative.\\n5. [FORUM] Using the effect of \"Pyramid of Wonders\" to prevent an attacking monster from being destroyed by \"Sakuretsu Armor\" would not cause a replay."
