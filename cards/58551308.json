    "Goat": "●If Blade Knight destroys Spear Cretin, Spear Cretin’s effect is not applied.\n●When a card that selects a card in the GY as a target, such as Monster Reborn, Mask of Darkness, Magician of Faith, Spear Cretin, or The Shallow Grave, is activated, you may chain Disappear to remove the targeted card from play, and the Monster Reborn, etc., will resolve without effect. This is because these cards select their target at activation, not resolution.\n●If you Flip Summon Spear Cretin while Skill Drain is applying, Spear Cretin's effect is negated when it is sent to the GY because it is a Flip Effect and Skill Drain negates Flip Effects.\n●If The End of Anubis is face-up on the field when a flipped Spear Cretin is sent to the GY, then Spear Cretin's effect does not activate. But if The End of Anubis was merely on the field when Spear Cretin was flipped, but is NOT on the field when Spear Cretin is sent to the GY, then Spear Cretin's effect DOES activate when sent to the GY because The End of Anubis is no longer on the field to negate it.“Spear Cretin’s” effect is optional. \nA player may not choose the same “Spear Cretin” that was destroyed as a target for its effect.\nA monster destroyed at the same time as “Spear Cretin” may not be chosen as the Special Summon for the effect of “Spear Cretin.”",
