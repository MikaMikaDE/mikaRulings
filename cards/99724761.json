These monsters cannot be Special Summoned from the Extra Deck except by the method described in their text. So they cannot be Special Summoned by the effect of \"Magical Scientist\" or \"Summoner of Illusions\". They cannot be Special Summoned from the GY even after they have been Special Summoned by the method described in their texts.\\n3. You must remove from play the monsters specified; you cannot use \"Goddess with the Third Eye\", etc., because you are not performing a Fusion Summon.\\n4. You CAN remove a face-down \"X-Head Cannon\", etc., from play to Special Summon one of these monsters from the Extra Deck.\\n5. The Special Summoning of these monsters from the Extra Deck has no Spell Speed and cannot be chained to (but can be negated with \"Solemn Judgment\")."
