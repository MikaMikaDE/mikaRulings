    "Goat": "● Since the effect of “Barrel Dragon” only destroys a monster if the coin toss is successful, is “Barrel Dragon” considered a targeting effect? \nA: Yes it is a targeting effect. You decide which monster you will attempt to destroy with the effect at the time you activate it. \n●Q: Can the effect of “Second Coin Toss” be used with “Barrel Dragon” and does the controller select 1 coin toss to redo or all 3? \nA: The player controling both Barrel Dragon and Second Coin Toss can redo the coin tosses with the effect of Second Coin Toss. They would redo all three coin tosses, not just one of them. \n●Q: When you use “Barrel Dragon” and flip a coin 3 times, does it need to be exactly 2 out of 3 or is it 2 or more out of 3?\nA: It is at least 2 out of the 3 called correctly. If you get 3 out of 3, you still meet the requirement for 2 out of 3.  02/23/04",
