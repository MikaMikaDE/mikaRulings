You cannot Special Summon monsters from the Extra Deck the turn you activate this effect, except Pendulum Monsters. You can only use this effect of \"Dream Tower of Princess Nemleria\" once per turn. If a \"Nemleria\" monster(s) you control would be destroyed by battle or an opponent's card effect, while you have \"Dreaming Nemleria\" face-up in your Extra Deck, you can banish 1 face-down card from your Extra Deck face-down, instead."
