It immediately regains ATK for each card in hand.\n● Vs \"Blackwing - Gale the Whirlwind\" and \"Black Garden\":\n These effects make the current ATK \"become\" halved.\nThe ATK remains halved and won't change even if number of cards in hand does.\n\nThe ③ Effect:\n● If that target isn't face-up at resolution, control is not changed.\n\nThe ④ Effect:\n● If that target leaves the GY, this card's level is not changed.",
