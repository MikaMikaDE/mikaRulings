You can detach 1 material from this card; this card gains ATK equal to the total original ATK of all other monsters on the field, then, if this card has a DARK Xyz Monster as material, negate the effects of all other face-up monsters on the field. After this effect resolves, you cannot declare attacks with other monsters for the rest of this turn. You can only use this effect of \"Arc Rebellion Xyz Dragon\" once per turn."
