    "Tengu": "(1) While you control another Six Samurai monster with a different name, this card can attack your opponent directly. (2) If this card would be destroyed, you can destroy another Six Samurai monster you control instead.\n●The (1) Continuous Effect does not activate, it applies on the field.\n●This effect only applies if you control another Six Samurai monster with a different name.\n●If your other “Six Samurai” is flipped face-down / leaves the field before the Damage Step (of the direct attack), a replay occurs. Do not proceed to the Damage Step for the direct attack.\n●The (2) Continuous Effect does not activate, it applies while the destruction occurs.\n●This effect does not target.\n●You cannot destroy a face-down Six Samurai monster instead.\n●You can apply this effect when an effect that destroys this card resolves (ex: Call of the Haunted).\n●Your other Six Samurai is considered destroyed by this effect, not by battle / card effect.\n●Example: If “Ring of Destruction” targets a “Six Samurai” monster, and you destroy a different “Six Samurai” monster instead, zero damage will be inflicted by “Ring of Destruction”.\n●You can apply this effect in Substep 4 - Damage Calculation. The “Six Samurai” that you destroy instead is sent to the GY in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step.\n●If multiple Six Samurai would be destroyed at once, you can destroy 1 other Six Samurai for each you wish to protect. You cannot only destroy 1 “Six Samurai” to protect all the others.\n●Example: If Mirror Force would destroy 2 of your Six Samurai monsters, you must destroy 2 Defense Position Six Samurai monsters to save those two\n●Example: If Mirror Force would destroy all your face-up Six Samurai monsters, you cannot destroy any of them as substitutes.\n●If you control 2 “Six Samurai” monsters, and 1 of them equipped with “Legendary Ebon Steed” would be destroyed, the effect of “Legendary Ebon Steed” must be used. You cannot choose to destroy another “Six Samurai” monster instead.",
