You can activate \"Rivalry of Warlords\" when either or both player(s) does not have any face-up monsters on the field, in which case once a player does have a face-up monster that monster's Type becomes that player's Type for purposes of \"Rivalry of Warlords\" (as long as the monster remains face-up on that player's side of the field).\\n4. When \"Rivalry of Warlords\" is activated, it has no effect on monsters that are face-down at that time and does not flip those monsters face-up.\\n5.

While \"Rivalry of Warlords\"/\"Gozen Match\" is active, you can still Set monsters of any Type/Attribute, and you can Special Summon monsters of the wrong Type/Attribute face-down. But you can’t Flip Summon them afterwards, and they’re sent to the GY after damage calculation if your opponent attacks them. Also, in that case, you won’t get the effects of cards that need to be destroyed by battle and sent to the GY, because they’re sent to the GY by the Trap Card’s effect instead. But Flip Effects will still activate.\\n16.You can return a 'Gladiator Beast' to your Deck and activate its effect as long as there is another 'Gladiator Beast' in your Deck that you COULD Summon that is the same Type/Attribute as the one you returned. However, if you have no face-up monsters when the effect resolves, you can Summon any Type/Attribute of monster.\\n17. If you control no face-up monsters, you can Summon a monster of any Type/Attribute.\\n18.  If \"Rivalry of Warlords\"/\"Gozen Match\" is being negated, you can Summon monsters of any Type/Attribute. If it stops being negated, you have to send monsters to the GY until you control only 1 Type/Attribute again, just like if \"Rivalry of Warlords\"/\"Gozen Match\" had just resolved."
