Dragon Ice itself can be discarded as cost, and then Special Summon from your GY.\n●The (2) Unclassified effect applies while Dragon Ice is face-up. This effect cannot be negated.\n●You can Special Summon multiple copies of Dragon Ice by Return from the Different Dimension. However, excess copies will be destroyed by game mechanic before you proceed to resolve the next link in the chain (or enter an open gamestate).",
