    "Edison": "Any monster that is Normal Summoned, Flip Summoned, or Special Summoned is changed to Defense Position.\n●The mandatory Trigger Effect always starts a Chain in the Summon response timing, even if the monster was Summoned by a card effect as Chain Link 2(+).\n●This effect activates as soon as a monster is successfully Summoned (or simultaneously with any mandatory Trigger Effects) before optional Trigger Effects (Red Gadget) or chained Spell / Trap Cards (Trap Hole). This supersedes Ignition Effect Priority.\n●Example: Player A controls Stumbling and a set Trap Hole. Player B Normal Summons Exiled Force. Stumbling’s mandatory Trigger Effect immediately starts a chain as Chain Link 1. Player B can't claim 'priority' to activate Exiled Force’s effect, but activates Mystical Space Typhoon as Chain Link 2 targeting Stumbling. Player A responds by activating Trap Hole as Chain Link 3. When resolving the chain, Trap Hole destroys Exiled Force, then Mystical Space Typhoon destroys Stumbling and the chain is considered resolved (as Stumbling is longer face-up on the field to allow for Chain Link 1 to resolve). The last thing to happen in this case was the destruction of Stumbling.",

Your opponent can activate Trap Hole as Step 2. You cannot chain Exiled Force because its effect is Spell Speed 1.
