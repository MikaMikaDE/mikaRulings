    "Base": "1. This card targets the monster that is being attacked.\\n2. You cannot shift the target of \"Power Frame\" with \"Tailor of the Fickle\".\\n3. If \"Rush Recklessly\" is Chained to \"Power Frame\" making the attack target monster's ATK greater than the attacking monster's ATK, you'll still increase the equipped monster's ATK by the new difference.\\n4. \"Elemental HERO Wildheart\" will not gain ATK from the effect of \"Power Frame\" because it is unaffected by Trap Cards."
