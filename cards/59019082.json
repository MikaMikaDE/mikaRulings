It happens on a new chain.\n  EG, If you control 2 copies of Lyla and this card:\n  You'll mill 3 for Lyla. On a new chain, you'll mill (and draw) for Garoth.\n  Then, on another new chain, you'll mill 3 for the other Lyla, then mill (and draw) for Garoth again.\n● Since Celestia, Lightworn Angel's effect to send cards to the GY is a cost, not an effect, Garoth's effect won't trigger because of it.",
