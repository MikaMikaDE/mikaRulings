    "Base": "1. This is a Trigger Effect that you can choose to activate. The cost is revealing 1 Fairy you just drew to your opponent.\\n2. If you control multiple copies of \"Tethys, Goddess of Light\", you can chain their effects when you draw a Fairy-Type monster(s). If you control 2 copies of \"Tethys, Goddess of Light\", you would draw 2 cards in that case.\\n3. You can only activate this effect when a Fairy being drawn was the last thing that happened. If you draw a Fairy with \"Jar of Greed\" in the middle of a chain, you cannot activate the effect of \"Tethys, Goddess of Light\". If you draw a Fairy with \"Graceful Charity\", the last thing that happened was that you discarded for \"Graceful Charity\", so you cannot activate \"Tethys, Goddess of Light\".\\n4. You can activate the effect of \"Tethys, Goddess of Light\" if you draw a Fairy during the Damage Step, for example with \"Airknight Parshath\"."
