Effects like Trap Hole would be Step 2.\n●When you Tribute Summon with 2 Zolgas, both Zolgas effects are activated. \n●Q: Does “Zolga’s” LP increase effect also apply to Ritual Tribute requirements? \nA: Nope. “Zolga”’s effect only applies to a Tribute Summon or Set. A Ritual Summon, although requiring Tributes, only counts as a Ritual Summon/Special Summon. \n●Q: When does “Zolga’s” effect activate? Can you chain to it? \nA: The effect of Zolga activates after the Tribute Summoned monster has been successfully Tribute Summoned. (Not negated by Horn of Heaven or Solemn Judgement.) You can chain to the effect of Zolga, but if Jinzo is the monster that was Tribute Summoned you would not be able to activate any Traps.   \n●Q: When is “Zolga’s” effect activated and will it be negated by “Skill Drain”? \nA: After the monster is offered for the Tribute Summon. Skill Drain will not be able to negate this. ",
