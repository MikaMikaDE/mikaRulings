If something happens to remove one of the monsters before then, “Book of Life” will do whatever it still can. Example: “Book of Life” is activated, and you choose to Special Summon “Spirit Reaper,” and remove the opponent's “Jinzo” in the GY from play. In response, the opponent activates their “Call of the Haunted” to Special Summon their “Jinzo.” Now, by the time “Book of Life” resolves, the “Jinzo” can no longer be removed from play. No problem, you just don't do that part of the effect (since you cannot choose a new monster), and your “Spirit Reaper” is still Special Summoned. Steve Okegawa, 01/07/2004",
