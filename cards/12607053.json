    "Goat": "●Waboku makes Battle Damage dealt by your opponent's monsters to your monsters and to your LP become zero.\n●Waboku applies to ALL of the monsters on that player's side of the field for the entire turn.\n●To illustrate how Waboku works, here are some scenarios and their results:SCENARIO 1: Player A's Mega Thunderball attacks Player B's Mega Thunderball, and Player B activates Waboku. RESULT: Player A's (attacking) Mega Thunderball is destroyed. Player B's Mega Thunderball (with equal ATK) is NOT destroyed.\n●SCENARIO 2: Player A activates Waboku. Player A's Mega Thunderball then attacks Player B's Mega Thunderball. RESULT: Player B's Mega Thunderball is destroyed. Player A's (attacking) Mega Thunderball is NOT destroyed. So you can use Waboku offensively when attacking an equal ATK monster.\n●SCENARIO 3: Player A activates Waboku. Player A's Blue-Eyes White Dragon then attacks Player B's Sanga of the Thunder. Player B uses Sanga of the Thunder's effect (during the Damage Step). RESULT: Player A's Blue-Eyes White Dragon (ATK 0) is not destroyed, nor does Player A lose any LP, because of Player A's Waboku.\n●SCENARIO 4: Player A's Mega Thunderball attacks Player B's Mega Thunderball. Player B activates Fairy Box or Mirror Wall. Player A activates Waboku. RESULT: Player A's Mega Thunderball (with reduced ATK) is not destroyed, nor does Player A lose any LP, because of Player A's Waboku. But because Player A's Mega Thunderball had reduced ATK, Player B's Mega Thunderball is not destroyed either.“Waboku” may not be activated in the Damage Step. \n●“Waboku” lasts for the turn it was activated in. \n●“Waboku’s” effect applies to all monsters on the side of the field of the player who activated “Waboku.” \n●“Waboku” only changes the battle damage of a monster inflicts to the controller of “Waboku” to 0. \n●“Waboku” does not alter ATK value. \n●If a monster protected by “Waboku” is attacked by or attacks a monster with the same ATK value that is not protected by “Waboku,” the other monster is destroyed in battle as normal. \n●Face-down monsters attacked while protected by “Waboku” will still flip face up.\n●Q: Player A declares an attack with a monster that has an equal ATK as the opponent’s monster. Player B activates “Waboku.” Player A chains with “Waboku.” What happens to the two monsters? \nA: Neither monster would be destroyed by the attack. \n●Q: If “Waboku” has been activated, will the damage from “Rod of the Mind’s Eye” or “Dark Scorpion Combination” be applied or will it also be reduced to 0? \nA: The Battle Damage will still be reduced to 0 by the effect of Waboku.",
