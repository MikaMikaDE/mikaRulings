    "Edison": "● While this effect is applying, effects of already face-up Spells/Traps also can’t be activated.\n(However, continuous Spell/Trap effects will still apply).\n●This means that if this effect is applying, the effect of Royal Oppression can’t be activated.\n●This also means that effects like that of Armory arm can't be activated, as it is being treated as a Spell Card.",

    "Goat": "“Cold Wave” may be chained to by appropriate Quick-Play Spell Cards or Trap Cards.\n●“Cold Wave” will prevent the activation of activated continuous effects, such as those of “Ultimate Offering” or “Call of the Mummy.” \n●If “Cold Wave’s” activation and effect are negated, a second “Cold Wave” may not be played that turn.\n●Union monsters may still use their effect of equipping themselves to an appropriate monster if “Cold Wave” has been activated.\n●If “Cold Wave” has been activated, “Cocoon of Evolution” may not be equipped onto “Petit Moth.”\n●If “Cold Wave” has been activated, “Thousand Eyes Restrict” may still use its effect to force a monster to equip to it.\n●Q: “Cold Wave” negates continuous spell and or trap cards, this includes equipments too, right? \nA: “Cold Wave” makes it so you can't play (activate) or Set Spell/Trap Cards, and extends to activating effects of Spell/Trap Cards already on the field. But “Cold Wave” will not negate continuous effects of cards like “United We Stand” that were in play BEFORE “Cold Wave” was activated.  12/08/2003\n●Q: Can Quick-Play Spell/Trap Cards be chained to the activation of “Cold Wave?” \nA: You can respond to “Cold Wave” by chaining any card that would be legal to activate at that time. If you let “Cold Wave” resolve successfully then neither you nor your opponent can play or Set any Spell/Trap cards. If someone activates “Cold Wave” I can respond with “Magic Jammer,” for instance.
