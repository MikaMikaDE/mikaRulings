If a card's cost would do this, it cannot activate.\n●Cards whose cost require a card(s) be discarded (ex: Magic Jammer) can be activated.\n●Cards / effects that send / discard a card(s) to the GY at resolution can be activated.\n●Examples: Dark Grepher, Foolish Burial, Blaze Accelerator, and Needlebug Nest.\n●If a face-up Archlord Kristya would be sent from the field to the GY (and removed from play), Archlord Kristya’s effect will still trigger and places it back on top of the Deck.\n●If Gravekeeper's Servant is active, your opponent cannot declare an attack.",
