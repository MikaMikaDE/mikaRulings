So, if I have a White Magicial Hat equipped with Germ Infection for 4 Standby Phases, it would be receiving -1200 to its ATK. (I would treat its ATK as 0, since 1000 - 1200 = -200) If I were to equip an Axe of Despair to that same White Magicial Hat, its ATK would be 1000 + 1000 [Axe] - 1200 [Germ Infection] = 800 ATK.  ",
