Player A: Activates “Fairy Box” and calls the coin toss correctly reducing the attacking monster’s ATK to 0. Is the damage to Player B considered Battle Damage and is “Airknight Parshath’s” effect activated? \nA: The attack would result in your opponent taking Battle Damage from a battle involved with your “Airknight Parshath.” You will draw a card from your deck after calculating the damage. “Airknight Parshath” does not have to be the one to initiate the attack. (It just tends to happen that way.)   ",
