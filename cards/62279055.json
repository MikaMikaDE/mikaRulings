    "Tengu": "● If that monster isn't face-up when this resolves, no damage is dealt.",
    "Goat": "●The effect of Magic Cylinder negates the attack of one attacking monster, but that monster is still considered to have attacked and may not attack again or have its Battle Position manually changed.\n●Monsters that may attack twice during the Battle Phase, such as Hayabusa Knight, that have their first attack negated by the effect of Magic Cylinder may still make a second attack.\n●If the attack of Goblin Attack Force or Spear Dragon is negated by the effect of Magic Cylinder, they will not be changed to Defense Position, since Damage Calculation never occurred.\n●The Damage caused by this card’s effect is equal to the current ATK of the attacking monster.\n●If an effect is chained to Magic Cylinder that destroys the attacking monster, or removes the attacking monster from the turn player’s side of the field (including switching it to your control, or sending it to the owner’s hand), no damage is dealt by the effect of Magic Cylinder. \n●Q: If a face-down monster is being attacked and “Magic Cylinder” is activated in response, will the face-down monster still be flipped face-up? \nA: A face-down monster would not flip due to battle if the attacking monster’s attack was negated by “Magic Cylinder.” The face-down monster attacked is flipped during the Damage Step. If the attack is stopped during the Battle Step then the monster would not be flipped. \n●  \n●Q: Does “Magic Cylinder” specifically designate a target? \nA: Yes, Magic Cylinder does specifically designate a target. \n●Steve Okegawa, 01/30/04\n●Q: Why doesn’t “Gravity Bind” negate the effect of “Magic Cylinder” if activated in chain with it and a level 4 monster? \nA: “Magic Cylinder's” target still exists face-up. It does not matter that the attack has stopped during resolution of the chain. You need to negate “Magic Cylinder's” activation/effect, turn the monster face-down, or remove them from the field in order to prevent the “Magic Cylinder” from properly resolving. This is different from a “Monster Reborn” who's target disappeared when “Call of the Haunted” Special Summoned it to the field. “Monster Reborn” resolves without effect because its target no longer exists in the GY. \n● \n●Q: If “Sasuke Samurai” attacks a face-down monster and the opponent activates “Magic Cylinder”, would “Sasuke Samurai’s” effect still destroy the face-down monster? \nA: “Magic Cylinder” would negate the monster’s attack during the Battle Step. “Sasuke Samurai” would not destroy the monster face-down if its attack is negated by “Magic Cylinder.” ",
