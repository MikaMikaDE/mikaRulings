If you Synchro Summon \"Brionac, Dragon of the Ice Barrier\" using a monster with a mandatory effect like \"Goblin Zombie\" as one of the Synchro Material Monsters, when the Synchro Summon is successful the effect of that monster will activate automatically. You will not be able to activate the Ignition effect of Brionac before the mandatory effect of \"Goblin Zombie\".\\n4. If 1 or more of the targeted cards are removed from the field before the effect resolves, the rest will still be returned to the owner's hand."
