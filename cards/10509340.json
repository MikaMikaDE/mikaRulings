Then, the turn player retains priority to declare an attack, there is not a window for the opponent to activate a Spell/Trap inbetween two consecutive \"Ancient Gear\" attacks.\n● ● If this card is destroyed by battle, this effect stops applying at the start of substep 6 of the Damage Step.\n\nAbout the ② effect:\n● This continuous effect effect applies from the moment the opponent's monster is destroyed by battle during Damage Calculation until it leaves the GY. If the destroyed monster is banished instead, its effects are not negated.",
