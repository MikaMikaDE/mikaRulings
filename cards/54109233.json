    "Goat": "● If “Infinite Dismissal” is applying on the field and I Flip Summon “Swarm of Scarabs” in MP 1 and then I use it's effect to flip it back face-down in MP 2, will it be destroyed in the End Phase? \nA: No. It resets when it flips back down.  02/02/04 \n●Q: “Infinite Dismissal” states that all monsters summoned that are level 3 or below are destroyed at the End Phase of the turn.. would this have priority over a summoned “Yata-Garasu,” or would “Yata-Garasu” return to your hand before “Infinite Dismissal” could destroy it? \nA: The Turn Player will decide which effect is resolved first. They will most likely choose to return their “Yata-Garasu first.”  ",
