The opponent chains “Rush Recklessly” to raise “Cyber Laser Dragon’s” ATK to 3100. “Jinzo” is not destroyed.\n●If “Book of Moon” is chained to “Cyber Laser Dragon’s” effect to turn either the targeted monster or “Cyber Laser Dragon” face-down, its effect will not resolve because both monsters’ ATK / DEF values can no longer be compared.",
