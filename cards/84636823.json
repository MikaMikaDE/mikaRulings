If “Mystical Space Typhoon” is used to destroy “Premature Burial” in a chain, then “Premature Burial” will be destroyed before it can summon “Spell Canceller.” Note that you CANNOT chain to the Tribute Summon of “Spell Canceller,” as summons have no Spell Speed. By the time it would be legal to chain with a Quick-Play Spell Card, it would no longer be legal because of “Spell Canceller's” Spell Cards cannot be activated effect. \n●Steve Okegawa, \n●Q: If the “Premature Burial” is equipped to “Spell Canceller,” and “Premature Burial” is destroyed while equipped ( i.e. “Dust Tornado”), would “Spell Canceller” be destroyed, or would its negation effect make it so it wouldn't be destroyed by “Premature Burial's” effect? \nA: If “Premature Burial” is destroyed while equipped to “Spell Canceller,” then “Spell Canceller” will remain on the field. The bond between “Spell Canceller” and “Premature Burial” does not apply, since “Premature Burial” is treated as a blank card due to “Spell Canceller's” effect. Steve Okegawa,   \n●Q: Can “Spell Canceller” negate the activation of “Spiritualism”? \nA: “Imperial Order” and “Spell Canceller” cannot negate the activation or effect of “Spiritualism.” ",
