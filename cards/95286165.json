This is because the Fusion Monster had not been Fusion Summoned. \n●Q: Can “De-Fusion” be used against an opponent’s X-Y-Z Fusion Monster to send it back to the Fusion Deck without Special Summoning the Fusion Material Monsters? \nA: “De-Fusion” can be used on the 4 X, Y, and Z Fusion variations. The result will be the X-Y-Z Fusion monster being returned to the Fusion Deck. No monsters will be Special Summoned from the GY because the X-Y-Z Fusions are not proper Fusion Summons. It will not matter if the X-Y-Z piece exists in the GY. This is similar to using “De-Fusion” on a Fusion Monster Special Summoned through the effect of “Magical Scientist” and/or “Summoner of Illusions.”",
