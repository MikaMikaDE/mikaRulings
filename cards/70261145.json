If \"Naturia Tulip\" stops being face-up on the field, your 'Naturia' monsters will lose the ATK gained.\\n3. If your opponent takes control of \"Naturia Tulip\" after its effect is applied, its effect will apply to your opponent's 'Naturia' monsters instead.\\n4. If you activate \"Mind Control\" to take control of \"Naturia Tulip\", its effect will not be applied because it is on your side of the field before its own effect would apply.\\n5. If \"Skill Drain\" is activated while the effect of \"Naturia Tulip\" is being applied, your monsters lose the ATK they gained. If \"Skill Drain\" is no longer applied later on, the ATK increase will be reapplied."
