But you can't Special Summon the barred monster Attribute. If you pick up a monster with that Attribute, it can't be Special Summoned and is sent to the GY. (And the effect of “Reasoning” ends.)\n● You can't activate “The Shallow Grave” while a Barrier Statue is in play if the only monsters in the opponent’s GY are barred monsters.\n● You can't activate “Future Fusion” or the effect of “Cyber-Stein” while a Barrier Statue is in play if the only Fusion Monsters in your Extra Deck have barred Attributes.\n● Effects that Special Summon, like “Jam Breeding Machine”, will activate while a Barrier Statue is in play, but if they would Special Summon a monster with a barred Attribute, no monster will be Special Summoned.\n● You can't activate “Magical Hats” while a Barrier Statue is in play.\n● You can't activate “Overload Fusion” while a Barrier Statue is in play (unless it is “Barrier Statue of the Abyss”).\n● Note that effects like “DNA Transplant” change monster Attributes only after they are on the field. So it has no impact on what monsters can be Special Summoned while a Barrier Statue is in play.",
