If “Banisher of Light” is on the field no cards will become removed from play because they are not being sent to the GY.\n●“Necrovalley” will negate the effect of “Exchange of the Spirit”.\n●“Exchange of the Spirit” does not target cards in the GY, so “Big Burn” cannot be activated.\n●“Exchange of the Spirit” is put into the new GY after it resolves.\n●You need 15 cards in your GY to activate “Exchange of the Spirit”. If you have exactly 15 and the opponent chains “Disappear” to remove from play 1 of those cards, “Exchange of the Spirit” was already activated correctly so it will resolve correctly.\n●Your opponent can have any number of cards in their GY when you activate Exchange of the Spirit, including 0.\n●If the opponent activates “Premature Burial” or “Call of the Haunted” you can chain “Exchange of the Spirit” (if you meet the requirements) to swap the cards in the Deck and the GY. Since the targeted monster is no longer in their GY, “Premature Burial” would be destroyed and “Call of the Haunted” would remain on the field meaninglessly.\n●Any Fusion Monsters or Synchro Monsters in the GY when “Exchange of the Spirit” resolves will be returned to the Extra Deck.\n●If “Parasite Paracide” is face-up in a Deck when “Exchange of the Spirit” resolves, it will be sent to its owner’s GY.",
