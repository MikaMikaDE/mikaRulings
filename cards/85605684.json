What about it it is flipped facedown and back to face-up? \nA: The ATK would reset to its base, 3500. \n●Q: Can “Berserk Dragon” (or “Exodia Necross” or “Dark Paladin”) be flipped facedown and then Flip Summoned? \nA: It is alright to Flip Summon them. \n●Q: If “Berserk Dragon” is equipped with “Shooting Star Bow – Ceal”, can it attack the opponent directly and then attack all monsters on the field or must the controller choose which effect to use?\nA: Berserk Dragon could either attack the opponent's monsters or it could attack directly. It would not be able to do both. ",
