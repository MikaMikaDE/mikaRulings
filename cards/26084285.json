Can it be used against “Mirage of Nightmare?” \nA: It works against card effects that would require the opponent to discard cards from their own hand, but not if the discard was a cost. “Graceful Charity” and “Card Destruction” come to mind. There really aren't many options. You cannot use “Gravekeeper's Watcher” against “Mirage of Nightmare.”   \n●Q: Can “Gravekeeper’s Watcher” prevent the discarding of “Kuriboh” from a player’s hand to reduce damage to 0? \nA: Discarding “Kuriboh” is a cost of activating its effect. You cannot activate Gravekeeper's Watcher's effect when a card is discarded as a cost, such as “Magic Jammer,” “Kuriboh,” “Tribute to the Doomed,” “Thunder Dragon,” or “Type Zero Magic Crusher.  ",
