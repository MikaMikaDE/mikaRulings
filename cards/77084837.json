    "Goat": "●This card can only attack LP directly. It cannot attack another monster. If the opponent controls Patrician of Darkness and you attack with Inaba White Rabbit, it is still a direct attack; they cannot select a monster as the attack target.\n●However, if the opponent controls a monster equipped with Ring of Magnetism, your Inaba White Rabbit must attack the equipped monster if you chose to attack.\n●Q: How is “Inaba White Rabbit” different from monsters like “Rainbow Flower?” \nA: The Inaba White Rabbit is a bit different than monsters like Rainbow Flower or the Toon monsters. Inaba White Rabbit has to attack directly. Its effect doesn't allow it to do otherwise unless it is forced to alter this by another card's effect. If the opponent has two Marauding Captains under their control, the Inaba White Rabbit can attack directly. If the opponent had 2 monsters equipped with Raregold Armor, the rabbit can STILL attack directly. If the opponent has 1 Marauding Captain equiped with Raregold Armor and another monster equipped with Raregold Armor the Inaba White Rabbit can STILL attack directly. The rabbit basically doesn't care, except for one guy: Ring of Magnetism. If an opponent's monster is equipped with Ring of Magnetism, the Inaba White Rabbit would have to attack that monster. This isn't a normal thing for the rabbit to do, but it is forced to by Ring of Magnetism. Hopefully this should clear things and up.   \n●Q: Can “Patrician of Darkness” redirect “Inaba White Rabbit’s” attack?\nA: Patrician of Darkness has no effect on Inaba White Rabbit. Inaba White Rabbit would not be attacking any of the monsters.   \n●Q: Is “Inaba White Rabbit” considered effect damage? Can I use it and “Robbin’ Goblin” to force a discard? \nA: It is Battle Damage and you will be able to activate “Robbin’ Goblin’s” effect with “Inaba White Rabbit.”  12/09/03",
