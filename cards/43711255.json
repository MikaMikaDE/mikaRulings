Declared Spell/Trap Cards Set before 'Prohibition' resolves can be activated.\n● After declaring a card for 'Prohibition', the declared card can't be changed.\n● If a Spell/Trap Card is declared with 'Prohibition', it can't be Set with 'Dust Tornado's' effect.\n● If a declared Monster Card is Special Summoned face-down (by 'Cyber Jar', etc.), when it is flipped face-up its effects are not applied.

'A Legendary Ocean' can't be declared with 'Prohibition', because its name is treated as 'Umi'.\n● If 'Prohibition' declares 'Jinzo' and afterwards it is negated by 'Imperial Order', if 'Jinzo' is Summoned it will negate 'Imperial Order', but its effects will still be applied because it is already on the field when 'Prohibition' is reapplied.\n● If 'Metalzoa' or 'Red-Eyes Black Metal Dragon' is declared with 'Prohibition', they can't be Special Summoned from the Deck.\n● If a 'Spirit Message' card is declared with 'Prohibition', it can still be placed onto the field by the effect of 'Destiny Board'.\n● If 'The Mask of Remnants' is declared with 'Prohibition', when 'Masked Beast Des Gardius' is sent to the GY and its effect activates, 'The Mask of Remnants' will be equipped from the Deck onto the opponent's monster.\n● If 'Neko Mane King' is declared with 'Prohibition', when 'Neko Mane King' is sent from the hand to the GY by the opponent's effect, its effect does not activate.
