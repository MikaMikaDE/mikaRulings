    "Base": "1. [FORUM] All \"Gateway of the Six\" needs in order to place the \"Bushido Counters\" on it, is for the monster to be successfully Summoned. If \"Bottomless Trap Hole\" is used in response to the Summon of a 'Six Samurai' monster, \"Gateway of the Six\" will gain the 2 \"Bushido Counters\".\\n2. [FORUM] When activating the effect of \"Gateway of the Six\", you only remove the number of counters based on the part of the effect you are activating. For example, you only remove 2 counters to activate the \"Until the End Phase of this turn, 1 face-up \"Six Samurai\" or \"Shien\" Effect Monster gains 500 ATK\" effect."
