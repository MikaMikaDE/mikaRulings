If your \"Dark Ruler Ha Des\" or other Fiend-Type monster destroys \"Tyrant Dragon\" as a result of battle, a Dragon-Type monster must still be Tributed when \"Tyrant Dragon\" is Special Summoned from the GY. This is because Tributing a Dragon-Type monster is a condition on the Summoning of the card; it is not part of the effect. For the same reason, if a Spirit Monster is destroyed by a Fiend-Type monster when \"Dark Ruler Ha Des\" is on the field, it still cannot be Special Summoned from the GY. Also if two \"Dark Ruler Ha Des\" destroy each other in battle, neither can be Special Summoned from the GY.\\n10. \"Dark Ruler Ha Des\" cannot be Special Summoned from the GY even if you try to Special Summon it face-down by the effect of \"Spear Cretin\" or \"The Shallow Grave\".\\n11. You can activate \"Return of the Doomed\" to return \"Dark Ruler Ha Des\" to your hand during the turn which it was destroyed, because this does not Special Summon it, it merely returns the card to your hand.\\n12. The effect of \"Fiber Jar\" will shuffle \"Dark Ruler Ha Des\" back into your Deck even if \"Dark Ruler Ha Des\" is in the GY and cannot be Special Summoned.\\n13. \"Dark Ruler Ha Des\" may be Special Summoned by \"Dimension Fusion\" or \"Return from the Different Dimension\" if it was removed from play."
