(C) The cards that are already on the field before this card's activation are unaffected by this effect.\n●The (1) Continuous Effect only applies while you control 1+ monster(s).\n●Your opponent can still Flip Summon monsters.\n●Your opponent can still activate Brain Control / Mind Control.\n●Your opponent can Tribute Summon if they would then control equal / fewer monsters than you do.\n●Your opponent cannot Tribute Summon if they would still control more monsters than you do.\n●Your opponent cannot activate cards / effects that Summon (ex: Scapegoat, Call of the Haunted).\n●VS. Cyber Jar: if your opponent would control more monsters, they must destroy monsters equal to the difference; the excess monsters are never actually Summoned and instead are sent from the Deck to the GY (so Sangan does not get its effect). So the monsters are destroyed after they are picked up, but before any monsters are Special Summoned for the effect of Cyber Jar.\n●The (C) Condition cannot be negated. It is not an Effect.\n●If there are already more monsters on your opponent's side of the field when you activate Kaiser Colosseum, nothing happens to them but your opponent cannot Summon any more.",
    "Goat": "●Your opponent can still Flip Summon a monster.\n●If there are already more monsters on your opponent's side of the field when you activate Kaiser Colosseum, nothing happens to your opponent's monsters but your opponent cannot Summon any more. Also, if the number of monsters controlled by Kaiser Colosseum's controller is reduced, the opponent does not have to remove any of his monsters.\n●Your opponent cannot use Monster Reborn, Scapegoat, etc. while Kaiser Colosseum prevents him from placing new monsters. However, your opponent CAN use Change of Heart, Snatch Steal, etc.\n●If all monsters of Kaiser Colosseum's controller are destroyed, Kaiser Colosseum's effect no longer functions until that player has at least 1 monster again (when the effect re-activates).\n●If the player who controls Kaiser Colosseum has his only monster taken by the opponent with Change of Heart, then the opponent can place more monsters because Kaiser Colosseum's effect is no longer applying until the player has at least 1 monster again.\n●When Kaiser Colosseum is applying, and Cyber Jar is activated, if your opponent would control more monsters than you, your opponent has to destroy monsters equal to the difference; the excess monsters are never actually Summoned and instead are sent from the Deck to the GY (so Witch of the Black Forest does not get its effect, etc.). So the monsters are destroyed after they are picked up, but before any monsters are Special Summoned for the effect of Cyber Jar. \n●Q: If my opponent destroys my only monster in battle while “Kaiser Colosseum” is applying on my side of the field, would my opponent have to send their monster to the GY to meet the condition of this effect? \nA: Kaiser Colosseum's effect only applies when the controller of Kaiser Colosseum has 1 or more monsters. Your opponent's monster would be fine. \n●  \n●Q: Can you Flip Summon a Set monster even if “Kaiser Coliseum” is “applying”? \nA: Yes, the card text states: ‘...your opponent may not place a monster on the field’, so you would not be able to Set another monster, but a monster already Set could be Flip Summoned. \n● 01/19/04\n●Q: If “Cyber Jar” is flipped while “Kaiser Colloseum” is applying, and the controller of “Kaiser Colloseum” would have fewer monsters than the other player, would the extra amount be sent to the GY? \nA: Yes.
