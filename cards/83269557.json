If \"Dark Valkyria\" becomes an Effect Monster again afterwards, its effect can be used once more.\nAbout the ② effect:\n● If \"Dark Valkyria\"'s ATK stat is frozen (e.g. by the effect of \"Blackwing - Gale the Whirlwind\" or \"Black Garden\") while it is considered an Effect Monster, it’s ATK will not increase for each Spell Counter on this card.",
