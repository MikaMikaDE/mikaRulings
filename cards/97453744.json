You can only use each of the following effects of \"Heroic Champion - Claivesolish\" once per turn. You can pay LP so that you only have 500 left; at the start of the Battle Phase this turn, double the ATK of 1 monster you control. When an attack is declared involving your opponent's monster: You can detach 1 material from this card, then target 1 face-up monster your opponent controls; this card gains ATK equal to that monster's ATK until the end of this turn."
