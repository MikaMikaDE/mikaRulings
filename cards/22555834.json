You can target 1 \"Fabled\" monster in your GY; discard 2 cards, and if you do, add that monster to your hand. You can only use this effect of \"Stairway to a Fabled Realm\" once per turn. If your \"Fabled\" monster attacks an opponent's monster and you have less cards in your hand than your opponent, your monster gains ATK equal to the difference in the number of cards x 200, during damage calculation only. You can only activate 1 \"Stairway to a Fabled Realm\" per turn."
