    "Goat": "● Can “Fairy’s Hand Mirror” be chained to cards that target monsters in the GY such as “Monster Reborn”? \nA: Fairy's Hand Mirror only works against Spell cards that target a monster card that exists on the field.   \n●Q: Does “Fairy's Hand Mirror” deflect both targeting aspects of “Riryoku”, or only one of them? \nA: You could not activate the effect of Fairy's Hand Mirror in response to Riryoku because the effect of the Riryoku targets more then 1 specific monster.
