All monsters your opponent controls lose 300 ATK.\n[ Monster Effect ] \nYou can Normal Summon this card without Tributing. If this card is Normal Summoned without Tributing, or is Special Summoned, its Level becomes 4 and its original ATK becomes 1800. If this card is Normal Summoned/Set, it is unaffected by activated effects from any monster whose original Level/Rank is lower than this card's current Level. When this card is Tribute Summoned by Tributing a \"Qli\" monster(s): You can activate this effect; if your opponent has more monsters in their Graveyard than you do, you gain LP equal to the difference x 300, and if you do, inflict the same amount of damage to your opponent."
