    "Goat": "● If a player has “Aqua Spirit” on the field and “Gravity Axe – Grarl” equipped to a monster, can the player use the effect of “Aqua Spirit” to change their opponent’s monster from face-up Defense Position to face-up Attack Position? \nA: Gravity Axe - Grarl only prevents the opponent from performing manual changes of their monster's battle positions. Card effects can still be used to change the battle positions of their monsters.   \n●Q: If a player takes control of a monster with “Snatch Steal” that is equipped with a “Gravity Axe – Grarl”, will the player now be allowed to change the Battle Position of their monsters? \nA: You would be able to manually change the battle position of your monsters at that time. Your opponent has to control both the Gravity Axe - Grarl and the monster the “Gravity Axe – Grarl” is equipped to in order to prevent you from being able to perform a manual change of battle position.
