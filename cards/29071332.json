    "Base": "1. [FORUM] You do not target the destroyed monster. The only thing that Armory Arm targets is the monster it equips to, and the effect itself does not target anything.\\n2. [FORUM] If a monster destroyed by the monster \"Armory Arm\" is equipped to is no longer in the GY when the effect of \"Armory Arm\" resolves to inflict damage, no damage will be inflicted since \"Armory Arm\" references the ATK of the monster \"the destroyed monster in the GY\".\\n\\nExample: If your Colossal Fighter were to be destroyed by a monster equipped with your Armory Arm, and you chose to activate the effect of Colossal Fighter, the chain forms like this:\\nChain Link 1: Armory Arm's damage-inflicting effect\\nChain Link 2: Colossal Fighter's summoning effect\\nIf Colossal Fighter revives himself, he's not there for Armory Arm to reference when Chain Link 1 resolves. So no damage will be inflicted."
