    "Goat": "“Thousand-Eyes Restrict” may equip itself with one monster at a time per turn. \n● “Thousand-Eyes Restrict’s” equipping effect is a targeting effect. \n●Monsters equipped to “Thousand-Eyes Restrict” do not have effects and are treated as Equip Spell Cards. \n●Monsters may not have their positions manually changed while “Thousand Eyes-Restrict” is on the field. \n●Monsters may change their position through a card effect while “Thousand Eyes-Restrict” is on the field. \n●If two “Thousand Eyes-Restricts” are on the field, no monster may attack.\n●“Imperial Order” has no effect on “Thousand-Eyes Restrict” as “Thousand-Eyes Restrict” determines the ATK/DEF value of “Thousand-Eyes Restrict.”\n●If a “Witch of the Black Forest” is equipped to “Thousand-Eyes Restrict” and sent to the GY, the effect of “Witch of the Black Forest” will activate.\n●Q:  What does cannot change their position mean here? Specifically, does it only apply to face up monsters? Many cards refer to battle position of face up monsters. This one doesn't. \nA: It means that a player cannot perform a manual change of battle position on any other monsters except for Thousand Eyes Restrict. This includes Flip-Summons.  \n● \n●Q: If you use “Thousand Eyes Restrict” to absorb a face down monster, are you entitled to look to see what it is or must it remain face down? \nA: Since you control the card you can peek and see what it is. \n● \n●Q: If “Thousand Eyes Restrict” is Special Summoned and declares the activation of its effect on the opponent’s “Gemini Elf”, can the opponent activate “Ring of Destruction”? \nA: The player controlling the Ring of Destruction could activate it when Thousand Eyes Restrict targets Gemini Elf with its effect. They could destroy the Gemini Elf in a chain. You could use Ring of Destruction and target the Thousand Eyes Restrict if you want to. You would use the same chain I demonstrated earlier, only the Thousand Eyes Restrict would be destroyed and would not be able to resolve its effect properly. ",
