    "Base": "1. Discarding cards is part of the effect, not a cost.\\n2. If \"Fabled Raven\" is no longer face-up on the field when its effect resolves you can still discard cards even though the Level cannot be increased.\\n3. Discarding cards, increasing the Level, and increasing the ATK all happen at the same time.\\n4. If \"Skill Drain\" is activated after the effect of \"Fabled Raven\" resolves, the effects of \"Fabled Raven\" will be negated and its Level and ATK will return to the original and will not go back to their increased values even if \"Skill Drain\" is destroyed later that turn."
