(However, if equipped after the effect of “Cybernetic Magician” resolves, the ATK will be adjusted from the new level of 2000 points.)\n●If a monster is getting an ATK adjustment because of a Field Spell Card, and you use the effect of “Cybernetic Magician” on it, then its ATK becomes 2000 and is not adjusted by the Field Spell Card until the effect of “Cybernetic Magician” expires. (However, if a new Field Spell Card is activated that changes the ATK, it will adjust it from the new 2000 ATK level.)\n●You can't target a monster with “Cybernetic Magician” if its ATK is already 2000 (like “Vampire Lord”).
