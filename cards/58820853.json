    "Base": "1. The Special Summoned monster's effect is negated as long as it remains face-up on the field.\\n2. CLARIFICATION: The effect of \"Blackwing - Shura the Blue Flame\" activates when monsters are destroyed and sent to the GY at the end of the Damage Step. This is the same timing as the effects of cards like \"Hydrogeddon\", \"Blue Thunder T-45\", \"Goyo Guardian\", and \"Elemental HERO Flame Wingman\".\\n\\nIn order for its effect to activate, \"Blackwing - Shura the Blue Flame\" must be face-up on the field when the monster it destroyed by battle is sent to the GY. This means:\\nIf \"Blackwing - Shura the Blue Flame\" and the other monster destroy each other by battle (equal ATK), the effect of \"Blackwing - Shura the Blue Flame\" does not activate.\\nIf \"Blackwing - Shura the Blue Flame\" is destroyed by a Flip Effect like \"Man-Eater Bug\", the effect of \"Blackwing - Shura the Blue Flame\" does not activate.\\nIf \"Blackwing - Shura the Blue Flame\" is flipped face-down after damage calculation by a card effect, such as \"Desertapir\", the effect of \"Blackwing - Shura the Blue Flame\" does not activate.\\nIf \"Blackwing - Shura the Blue Flame\" is removed from play by battling \"D.D. Warrior\", the effect of \"Blackwing - Shura the Blue Flame\" does not activate.\\nIf \"Blackwing - Shura the Blue Flame\" is destroyed by an effect after the monster it destroyed by battle was sent to the GY, such as \"Michizure\", the effect of \"Blackwing - Shura the Blue Flame\" DOES activate, and you can Special Summon a monster.\\n\\nNOTE: These rules also apply to any other monster with the text 'When this card destroys an opponent's monster by battle and sends it to the GY….' (Examples: \"Hydrogeddon\", \"Goyo Guardian\", or \"Elemental HERO Flame Wingman\".)\\n\\nThese rules do NOT apply to monsters with the text 'When this card destroys an opponent's monster by battle….' (but does not specify 'and sends it to the GY'). (Example: \"Blue Thunder T-45\".) Monsters with that text will activate their effects in ALL of the above scenarios."
