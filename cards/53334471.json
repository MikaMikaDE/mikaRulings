While \"Gozen Match\" is face-up on the field, you can Summon monsters with multiple Attributes, such as \"Light and Darkness Dragon\" or \"Elemental Mistress Doriado\", but they will be immediately sent to the GY.\\n3. You can take control of an opponent’s monster that’s the wrong Type/Attribute with a card like “Mind Control”. If you do, it’s sent to the GY immediately after you gain control of it.\\n4. While \"Rivalry of Warlords\"/\"Gozen Match\" is active and you have a face-up monster, you cannot Summon monsters that are a different Type/Attribute from the monster(s) you already control.\\n5. While \"Rivalry of Warlords\"/\"Gozen Match\" is active, you can still Set monsters of any Type/Attribute, and you can Special Summon monsters of the wrong Type/Attribute face-down. But you can’t Flip Summon them afterwards, and they’re sent to the GY after damage calculation if your opponent attacks them. Also, in that case, you won’t get the effects of cards that need to be destroyed by battle and sent to the GY, because they’re sent to the GY by the Trap Card’s effect instead. But Flip Effects will still activate.\\n6.You can return a 'Gladiator Beast' to your Deck and activate its effect as long as there is another 'Gladiator Beast' in your Deck that you COULD Summon that is the same Type/Attribute as the one you returned. However, if you have no face-up monsters when the effect resolves, you can Summon any Type/Attribute of monster.\\n7. If you control no face-up monsters, you can Summon a monster of any Type/Attribute.\\n8.  If \"Rivalry of Warlords\"/\"Gozen Match\" is being negated, you can Summon monsters of any Type/Attribute. If it stops being negated, you have to send monsters to the GY until you control only 1 Type/Attribute again, just like if \"Rivalry of Warlords\"/\"Gozen Match\" had just resolved."
