Using the effect of “Book of Taiyou” is not considered Flip-Summon, so it would be fine to do this.   \n●Q: Can “Guardian Grarl” be Special Summoned with its effect if “Gravity Axe – Grarl” is not on the field? \nA: The text on “Guardian Grarl” states that “This card can only be Normal Summoned, Flip Summoned, or Special Summoned when there is a “Gravity Axe − Grarl” on your side of the field.” You would need to have the “Gravity Axe − Grarl” in play on your side of the field.  \n●Q: If you had a monster on the field with “Gravity Axe – Grarl” equipped, could you Tribute it to Summon “Guardian Grarl”? \nA: You cannot Tribute the only monster equipped with Gravity Axe - Grarl to Tribute Summon Guardian Grarl. Of course, Special Summoning Guardian Grarl is fine, if you have Gravity Axe - Grarl equipped to a monster and Guardian Grarl is the only card in your hand. Steve Okegawa, 02/18/04",

    "Base": "1. If you wish to use the effect of \"Guardian Grarl\" to Special Summon him from your hand, you still must have \"Gravity Axe - Grarl\" on your side of the field.\\n2. You cannot Tribute Summon \"Guardian Grarl\" by Tributing a monster equipped with your only \"Gravity Axe - Grarl\" on your side of the field, because the \"Gravity Axe - Grarl\" will no longer be on the field when the Summon occurs.\\n3. GUARDIANS: \"Guardian Baou\", \"Guardian Ceal\", \"Guardian Elma\", \"Guardian Grarl\", \"Guardian Kay'est\", and \"Guardian Tryce\" all share some basic rules. Using \"Guardian Elma\" as an example:\\n\\nYou can Set \"Guardian Elma\" face-down without \"Butterfly Dagger - Elma\", but you cannot Special Summon her face-down with \"The Shallow Grave\", etc., unless you have \"Butterfly Dagger - Elma\" on your side of the field.\\n10. If your Set \"Guardian Elma\" is flipped face-up with \"Swords of Revealing Light\", or by an attack, without \"Butterfly Dagger - Elma\" on your side of the field, she remains on the field because she was not Summoned.\\n\\n\"Guardian Elma\" is a normally Summoned monster, not a Special Summon-only monster. So if Normal Summoned she counts as your 1 Summon for the turn.\\n\\nYou cannot use \"Monster Reborn\" on \"Guardian Elma\" if you do not have \"Butterfly Dagger - Elma\" on your side of the field.\\n\\nIf you activate \"Monster Reborn\" and target \"Guardian Elma\" while you have \"Butterfly Dagger - Elma\" on the field, and your opponent chains \"Mystical Space Typhoon\" to destroy \"Butterfly Dagger - Elma\", so that it is no longer on the field when \"Monster Reborn\" resolves, you cannot Special Summon \"Guardian Elma\" and the effect of \"Monster Reborn\" disappears.\\n\\nYou can Normal Summon, Flip Summon, or Special Summon \"Guardian Elma\" even if your \"Butterfly Dagger - Elma\" has its effect negated by \"Imperial Order\".\\n\\nIf \"Cyber Jar\" resolves and you pick up \"Guardian Elma\" without \"Butterfly Dagger - Elma\" on your side of the field, \"Guardian Elma\" is added to your hand.\\n\\nThese rules apply to all six of these monsters."
