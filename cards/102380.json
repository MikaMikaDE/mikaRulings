    "Goat": "●Lava Golem must be Special Summoned to your opponent’s side of the field using its effect text; you cannot Special Summon it or Tribute Summon it to your side of the field.\n●However, if Special Summoned correctly and then sent to the GY, you can use Monster Reborn to Special Summon Lava Golem to your side of the field, but you (as the controller) will then take the 1000 damage during your Standby Phases.\n●You cannot Summon or Set and then Special Summon Lava Golem.\n●If you Special Summon Lava Golem onto your opponent’s side of the field they can activate Bottomless Trap Hole since you performed the Summon.

It is a condition that is applied when you Special Summon the Lava Golem.",
