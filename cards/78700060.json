    "Cat": "● “Doomcaliber Knight’s” effect is a Quick Effect. When an Effect Monster’s effect is activated, “Doomcaliber Knight’s” effect activates in a Chain to that effect. This effect does not target.\n● Tributing 'Doomcaliber Knight' is a cost. \n● 'Doomcaliber Knight's' effect can activate during the the Damage Step.\n● 'Doomcaliber Knight's' effect will not activate while 'Mask of Restrict' is applying, because it can't be Tributed.\n● If 'Kuriboh's' effect is activated to negate the Battle Damage from 'Doomcaliber Knight', 'Doomcaliber Knight' is Tributed to negate 'Kuriboh's' effect. Damage has already been calculated, so if 'Doomcaliber Knight' was attacking a monster with equal or lower ATK that monster will be destroyed, and Battle Damage will be inflicted as normal.\n● If 'Doomcaliber Knight's' effect activates while 'Skill Drain' is applying, its effect isn't negated because it isn't on the field when its effect resolves.\n● If 'Doomcaliber Knight' is destroyed by battle and an Effect Monster's effect activates after damage calculation ('D.D. Warrior Lady', etc.), 'Doomcaliber Knight's' effect still activates.\n● If an Effect Monster's effect is activated while multiple 'Doomcaliber Knights' are applying, they all activate and are Tributed. Their effects are chained following the rules for simultaneous effects (see the Advanced Rulings FAQ). Only the last 'Doomcaliber Knight' to resolve will be applied, and the effects of the other 'Doomcaliber Knights' disappear.Example: Player A controls 2'Doomcaliber Knights'. Player B activates an Effect Monster's effect. Both of Player A's 'Doomcaliber Knight' activate and form a Chain:Effect Monster --&gt; Doomcaliber Knight A --&gt; Doomcaliber Knight BOnly Doomcaliber Knight A negates the Effect Monster's effect.\n● When multiple Effect Monster effects activate simultaneously, 'Doomcaliber Knight's' effect is chained after determining the order of the Effect Monster effects (see the Advanced Rulings FAQ 'Simultaneous Effects) and will negate the Effect Monster’s effect that was placed last on the Chain.Example 1: Player A Tributes her 'Sangan' and 'Witch of the Black Forest' to Tribute Summon 'Dark Magician'. 'Sangan’s' effect is Chain Link 1 and 'Witch of the Black Forest’s' effect is Chain Link 2. The effect of Player B's 'Doomcaliber Knight' is chained, and it will negate 'Witch of the Black Forest's' effect.Example 2: Player A and Player B have 'Goldd, Wu-Lord of Dark World' in their hand and Player A controls 'Doomcaliber Knight'. Player A activates 'Card Destruction'. When both copies of 'Goldd, Wu-Lord of Dark World' are discarded, their effects start a Chain. Player A is the turn player, so his 'Goldd, Wu-Lord of Dark World' is Chain Link 1 and Player B's is Chain Link 2. 'Doomcaliber Knight's' effect is chained, and it will negate Player B's 'Goldd, Wu-Lord of Dark World'.Example 3: Player A's 'Giant Rat' is destroyed in battle and sent to the GY while she has 'Green Baboon, Defender of the Forest' in her hand and 'Doomcaliber Knight' is applying. Player A can activate 'Giant Rat' and/or 'Green Baboon, Defender of the Forest's' effect. If she activates both effects, she chooses the order the effects are placed onto the Chain, and 'Doomcaliber Knight' will negate the effect that is placed highest on the Chain. If 'Green Baboon, Defender of the Forest' is Chain Link 1 and 'Giant Rat' is Chain Link 2, 'Doomcaliber Knight' will negate 'Giant Rat'.Example 4: If 'Sangan' is Tributed to Tribute Summon 'Raiza the Storm Monarch' while 'Doomcaliber Knight' is applying, 'Sangan's' effect is Chain Link 1 and 'Raiza the Storm Monarch's' effect is Chain Link 2. 'Doomcaliber Knight's' effect is chained, negating 'Raiza the Storm Monarch's' effect and destroying it.Example 5: Player A's 'Sasuke Samurai #4' attacks Player B's 'Neo-Spacian Grand Mole' while 'Doomcaliber Knight' is applying. 'Sasuke Samurai #4's' effect is Chain Link 1 and 'Neo-Spacian Grand Mole' is Chain Link 2. 'Doomcaliber Knight's' effect is chained, and it will negate and destroy 'Neo-Spacian Grand Mole'.\n● If an Effect Monster’s effect that isn't optional activates, even if it would not do anything when it resolves, it will still be negated by “Doomcaliber Knight”. Example: Player A’s face-down “Magician of Faith” is attacked by Player B’s “Doomcaliber Knight” while Player A has no Spell Cards in his GY. “Magician of Faith’s” Flip Effect activates and “Doomcaliber Knight’s” effect activates in a Chain to it.\n● If your 'Doomcaliber Knight' attacks an Effect Monster with a non-continuous effect and destroys it while you control 'Dark Ruler Ha Des', when the Effect Monster's effect activates 'Doomcaliber Knight's' effect is still chained.\n● If 'Doomcaliber Knight's' effect would destroy a monster on the field, 'My Body as a Shield' can be chained.\n● Even if 'Book of Moon', etc., is chained to 'Doomcaliber Knight's' effect and flips the Effect Monster face-down, the Effect Monster's effect is still negated by 'Doomcaliber Knight' and it is still destroyed.\n● If 'Light and Darkness Dragon' and 'Doomcaliber Knight' are applying when a Spell/Trap Card is activated, 'Light and Darkness Dragon's' effect is chained to the Spell/Trap Card and 'Doomcaliber Knight's' effect is chained to 'Light and Darkness Dragon'.\n● If 'Doomcaliber Knight' attacks an Attack Position 'Reflect Bounder', when 'Reflect Bounder's' effect activates 'Doomcaliber Knight's' effect is chained. 'Doomcaliber Knight' negates 'Reflect Bounder's' effect and destroys it. Damage Calculation isn't conducted.\n● If 'Crystal Beast Ruby Carbuncle's' effect is activated when it is Special Summoned and 'Doomcaliber Knight's' effect is activated, 'Doomcaliber Knight' will negate the effect of 'Crystal Beast Ruby Carbuncle' that Special Summons 'Crystal Beast' monsters and destroy it. The player controlling 'Crystal Beast Ruby Carbuncle' can place it into their Spell/Trap Card Zone.",
