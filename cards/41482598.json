If you discard \"Sinister Serpent\" during your Standby Phase for the effect of \"Mirage of Nightmare\", you may add \"Sinister Serpent\" back to your hand during that same Standby Phase.\\n9. If you have multiple copies of \"Mirage of Nightmare\", you don't draw for more than 1 because you have 4 cards in your hand from using the effect of only 1 of them; nor do you have to discard for the second copy because you didn't draw any cards using its effect. If you draw so that you have 4 cards using 1 \"Mirage of Nightmare\", and some effect causes you to discard during that same Standby Phase, you may then activate the other \"Mirage of Nightmare\" to draw back up to 4; in this case you discard separately for each \"Mirage of Nightmare\" because you drew with both, and if 1 of them is destroyed you do not have to discard for its effect, only for the effect of the \"Mirage of Nightmare\" that was not destroyed.\\n10. If you have 4 or more cards in your hand during your opponent's Standby Phase, do not draw, and do not discard during your next Standby Phase (the effect of \"Mirage of Nightmare\" is not applied).\\n11. If your Standby Phase is skipped because of \"Solomon's Lawbook\", etc., do not discard for \"Mirage of Nightmare\".\\n12. Drawing for \"Mirage of Nightmare\" is considered 1 draw no matter how many cards are drawn, so you only gain 500 Life Points if you have \"Solemn Wishes\".\\n13. If you draw 3 cards for \"Mirage of Nightmare\", but only have 2 cards in your hand during your next Standby Phase, discard your entire hand (2 cards)."
