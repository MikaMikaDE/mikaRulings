If \"Remove Brainwashing\" is active and you Special Summon your opponent's Synchro Monster with \"Monster Reborn\", control of the monster is immediately shifted back to your opponent and the monster is treated as being Special Summoned on your opponent's side of the field, so you can activate the effect of \"Shiny Black 'C'\".\\n6. If \"Book of Moon\" is Chained to the effect of \"Shiny Black 'C'\" to flip the targeted monster face-down, the monster is not destroyed because it cannot be identified as a Synchro Monster.\\n8.
