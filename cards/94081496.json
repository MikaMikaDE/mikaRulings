    "Base": "1. This effect is a Quick Effect that activates in the GY.\\n2. Removing \"Shiny Black 'C'\" from play is a cost to activate its effect.\\n3. This effect targets the Synchro Monster that was Special Summoned.\\n4. You cannot activate this effect during the Damage Step.\\n5. If \"Remove Brainwashing\" is active and you Special Summon your opponent's Synchro Monster with \"Monster Reborn\", control of the monster is immediately shifted back to your opponent and the monster is treated as being Special Summoned on your opponent's side of the field, so you can activate the effect of \"Shiny Black 'C'\".\\n6. If \"Book of Moon\" is Chained to the effect of \"Shiny Black 'C'\" to flip the targeted monster face-down, the monster is not destroyed because it cannot be identified as a Synchro Monster.\\n8. You can only activate the effect of \"Shiny Black 'C'\" when 1 monster is Special Summoned and it is a Synchro Monster."
