(the monster has less than 1300 ATK) Is the monster is destroyed or not? \nA: Equip cards specifically designate a target. “Ekibyo Drakmord” is an equip card. Monsters that are equipped with “Heart of Clear Water” cannot be destroyed by the effects of any card that specifically designates a target including “Premature Burial” and “Call of the Haunted,” or “Ekibyo Drakmord.”   \n●Q: What happens to “Ekibyo Drakmord” if it is equipped to a monster that is also equipped with “Heart of Clear Water”? \nA: The Ekibyo Drakmord will remain equipped to the monster. The monster will still not be able to attack due to the effect of Ekibyo Drakmord.  ",
