Player B chains the effect with “DNA Surgery” declaring a different Type. Will the effect of “Tribe-Infecting Virus” resolve with no effect since the Type of all monsters has changed? \nA: Correct. The Type declared when Tribe-Infecting Virus' effect was activated no longer exists on the field due to DNA Surgery, so its effect will disappear. The monster would not be destroyed. ",
