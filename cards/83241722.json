You would not wait until the Archfiend die roll. If you wait that long then you will already be resolving the chain, and at that point it would be too late to activate the Dice Re-roll. So you would want the chain to look like this: Change of Heart --> Dice Re-roll The Archfiend dice roll occurs when Change of Heart resolves. It does not add any steps into the chain. \n●Q: If “Dice Re-Roll’s” effect is used for the flip of “Dice Jar”, can you decide to re-roll your own and leave your opponent’s die roll? \nA: BOTH players would have to re-roll the die.",
