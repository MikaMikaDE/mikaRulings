Continuous Effects that do not start a Chain cannot be negated by \"Koa'ki Meiru Doom\" because they do not 'activate'.\n\\n3. \"Koa'ki Meiru Doom\" will negate effects that activate outside of the field (such as the GY or Removed Zone), as long as it is during the Main Phase.\n\\n4. The effect of \"Koa'ki Meiru Doom\" is a Continuous Effect."
