When you Normal Summon Nuvia the Wicked its effect activates. If Skill Drain's effect is negated or Skill Drain is removed from the field before Nuvia the Wicked's effect resolves, Nuvia the Wicked would be destroyed when its effect resolves. Nuvia the Wicked's Normal Summon effect is a trigger, and as such it can be chained to. Skill Drain wont negate the activation of Nuvia the Wicked's effect but it will negate the effect when it resolves. So if the opponent were to chain Mystical Space Typhoon to the effect and destroy the Skill Drain, Nuvia the Wicked would be destroyed when the its effect resolves. If Nuvia the Wicked is on the field past its Normal Summon effect having resolved it will not matter if Skill Drain is destroyed. ",
