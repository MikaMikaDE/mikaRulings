Then, the turn player retains priority to declare an attack, there is not a window for the opponent to activate a Spell/Trap inbetween two consecutive \"Ancient Gear\" attacks.\n● If this card is destroyed by battle, this effect stops applying at the start of substep 6 of the Damage Step.\n\nAbout the ③ effect:\n● This mandatory Trigger Effect starts a chain and targets a Spell/Trap your opponent controls.\n● This card must remain face-up on the field to activate this effect, it will not activate if this card is destroyed by battle.",
