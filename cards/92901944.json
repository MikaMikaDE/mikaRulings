    "Base": "1. This card's effect cannot be used during the Damage Step.\\n2. If the 'Scrap' monster is destroyed while face-down, you can't activate the effect of \"Scrap Searcher\".\\n3. The effect to destroy all your face-up monsters except for 'Scrap' monsters activates no matter how \"Scrap Searcher\" is Special Summoned.\\n4. The 'Scrap' monster that is destroyed must be a 'Scrap' monster in the GY as well as on the field.\\n5. That means you can't use it when a \"Phantom of Chaos\" that's copying a 'Scrap' monster is destroyed.\\n6. If you Special Summon \"Scrap Searcher\" to your opponent's side of the field with \"Scrap Golem\", your opponent's face-up monsters will be destroyed, except for 'Scrap' monsters."
