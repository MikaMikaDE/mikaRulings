If you use Karate Man's effect, and THEN equip him with Megamorph after that, and Megamorph would halve his ATK, then his ATK is 500.\n●If the effect of Shrink is applied after Karate Man's effect has been used, its ATK will become 500.

    "Goat": "●If Karate Man is equipped with Megamorph and its ATK is being halved, if you then activate its effect, its ATK is 2000. If you activate its effect and then equip it with Megamorph while your LP are greater than your opponent’s, its ATK is 500. If Karate Man is equipped with Megamorph and you activate its effect, or if you activate its effect and then equip it with Megamorph while your LP are less than your opponent’s, its ATK is 2000.  \n●Q: Would “Messenger of Peace” effectively stop “Karate Man” from using his effect? \nA: “Karate Man's” effect is Spell Speed 1, and it can only be activated during one of your own Main Phases. Since “Karate Man's” ATK would be over 1500 before you declare the attack, you definitely cannot attack after using “Karate Man's” effect if “Messenger of Peace” is on the field. Similarly, as “Karate Man” is a Spell Speed 1 effect, it cannot be used during the opponent's turn at all. So, if a “Gemini Elf” (for example) attacks your “Karate Man,” you don't get to use the effect and “Karate Man” is destroyed from battle. ",
