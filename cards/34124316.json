Monsters that go to the GY in this way are considered being sent from the Deck to the GY.\n●If Special Summon monsters are revealed through the effect of “Cyber Jar”, including “Relinquished”, “Toons”, or similar, they are sent to the hand.\n●Q: When attacked, does “Cyber Jar” kill itself, or is it destroyed by battle? \nA: It is destroyed by battle, provided that the attacking monster’s ATK is high enough.
