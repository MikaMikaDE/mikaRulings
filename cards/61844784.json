The counter used for “Magic Reflector” is only for “Magic Reflector's” effect. \n●  \n●Q: If you activate “Magic Reflector” on a Field Spell Card and your opponent plays another Field Spell Card, what happens? \nA: Your Field Spell Card with a counter is destroyed and the new Field Spell Card takes priority.
