Nor is it destroyed if equipped to “Gearfried the Iron Knight.” It can be returned to hand (“Giant Trunade”), or negated (“Imperial Order,” “Freed the Matchless General),” or sent to the GY (“Emergency Provisions”).   \n●Q: If I equip “Fusion Sword Murasame Blade” to “Spirit Reaper,” would “Spirit Reaper” be destroyed or would this be an illegal activation? \nA: You wouldn't even be able to target him with it at all. “Spirit Reaper” is not a Warrior. It would be an illegal activation in this case. If “Spirit Reaper” were turned into a Warrior through “DNA Surgery”, equipping “Fusion Sword Masamune Blade” to “Spirit Reaper” would cause “Spirit Reaper” to destroy itself through its effect.  ",
