If a monster that was Special Summoned is Set, it can still be destroyed by the effect of Jowgen the Spiritualist.\n●While this card is on the field neither player can activate Scapegoat, Monster Reborn, Call of the Haunted, Magical Hats, Dedication through Light and Darkness, or any other card that Special Summons a monster.\n●If Jowgen the Spiritualist is Special Summoned by the effect of Cyber Jar, all monsters that are Special Summoned by that Cyber Jar are Summoned successfully.\n●You cannot Special Summon Lava Golem if the opponent has Jowgen the Spiritualist face-up on the field, nor can you Tribute their Jowgen the Spiritualist to Special Summon Lava Golem.\n●While “Jowgen the Spiritualist” is face up and applying on the field, monsters may not be Special Summoned, either face up or face down. \n●Monsters that have been Special Summoned face down may still be destroyed by “Jowgen the Spiritualist’s” effect.\n●Q: With “Jowgen the Spiritualist” on the field, can I still Special Summon face-down? Will face-down Special Summoned Monsters still be affected by Jowgen’s effect? \nA: “Jowgen the Spiritualist” prohibits special summons after its own successful summoning. It is not specific in the card text as to only face-up special summoned monsters. Some monsters can be Special Summoned face-down either by their own effect or the effect of another card. These are still Special Summons and prohibited by “Jowgen the Spiritualist”. Therefore, even monsters that have been Special Summoned face-down prior to “Jowgen the Spiritualist's” appearance on the field are subject to its effect. \n●Q: If “Jowgen the Spiritualist” is summoned by the effect of “Cyber Jar first,” what happens? \nA: All monsters summoned by “Cyber Jar” are done so at the same time, so they would be successfully summoned. \n●Q: If there is a “Jowgen the Spiritualist” face up on my opponent’s side of the field and my opponent activates “Last Turn”, where does the monster I would normally Special Summon go? \nA: This is stated on the card itself: ‘Your opponent must then Special Summon 1 monster from his/her Deck ...’ If “Jowgen the Spiritualist” is on your opponent’s side of the field, then you could not ‘Special Summon 1 monster from your Deck.’ It doesn’t go anywhere, you cannot do it. \n●Q: If “Jowgen the Spiritualist” is on the field, can you repeatedly activate “Magical Scientist’s” effect to pay 1000 LP repeatedly for no effect? \nA: No, you may not. Jowgen the Spiritualist prevents the activation of effects that Special Summon monsters to the field. ",
