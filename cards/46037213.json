If it isn't, then that part of Guardian Tryce's effect would disappear.   \n●Q: If Player B uses “Change of Heart” on Player A’s monster and Tributes it for “Guardian Tryce”, when “Guardian Tryce” is destroyed, does Player A’s monster get Special Summoned to Player B’s field? \nA: Yes. bishop 02/23/04 \n●Q: If I use “Soul Exchange” one of my opponent's monsters for the tribute, and “Guardian Tryce” is destroyed, would I get to special summon the opponent's monster on my side of the field? \nA: If that exact monster used for the Tribute Summon of “Guardian Tryce” is still in the opponent's GYthen you would be able to Special Summon that monster per “Guardian Tryce's” effect. Note: You could not do this if the tributed monster was “Dark Ruler Ha Des” or was a monster that had Special Summon requirements that would prevent it from being Special Summoned.  ",

You cannot use the effect of \"Guardian Tryce\" to Special Summon a 'Special Summon-only' monster that had not been properly Summoned, such as a Fusion Monster that was Special Summoned with \"Magical Scientist\" and then Tributed for \"Guardian Tryce\".\\n4. You cannot Special Summon \"Dark Ruler Ha Des\" with the effect of \"Guardian Tryce\".\\n5.

GUARDIANS: \"Guardian Baou\", \"Guardian Ceal\", \"Guardian Elma\", \"Guardian Grarl\", \"Guardian Kay'est\", and \"Guardian Tryce\" all share some basic rules. Using \"Guardian Elma\" as an example:\\n\\nYou can Set \"Guardian Elma\" face-down without \"Butterfly Dagger - Elma\", but you cannot Special Summon her face-down with \"The Shallow Grave\", etc., unless you have \"Butterfly Dagger - Elma\" on your side of the field.\\n10.

So if Normal Summoned she counts as your 1 Summon for the turn.\\n\\nYou cannot use \"Monster Reborn\" on \"Guardian Elma\" if you do not have \"Butterfly Dagger - Elma\" on your side of the field.\\n\\nIf you activate \"Monster Reborn\" and target \"Guardian Elma\" while you have \"Butterfly Dagger - Elma\" on the field, and your opponent chains \"Mystical Space Typhoon\" to destroy \"Butterfly Dagger - Elma\", so that it is no longer on the field when \"Monster Reborn\" resolves, you cannot Special Summon \"Guardian Elma\" and the effect of \"Monster Reborn\" disappears.\\n\\nYou can Normal Summon, Flip Summon, or Special Summon \"Guardian Elma\" even if your \"Butterfly Dagger - Elma\" has its effect negated by \"Imperial Order\".\\n\\nIf \"Cyber Jar\" resolves and you pick up \"Guardian Elma\" without \"Butterfly Dagger - Elma\" on your side of the field, \"Guardian Elma\" is added to your hand.\\n\\nThese rules apply to all six of these monsters."
