Your opponent's turns are counted as well. Once your next turn happens, that turn is considered the third turn, because your opponent's turn was the second turn. Is that basically what you wanted to know? Steve Okegawa,  \n●Q: When exactly is the win declared for “Final Countdown”? \nA: You win after the End Phase of the 20th turn. This is because 20 turns must have passed, as the card states. Steve Okegawa,  \n●Q: Does “Final Countdown” stay on the field for the duration of its effect? \nA: No it does not.  \n●Q: If I've already activated “Final Countdown” and my opponent plays continuous spell negating cards (“Imperial Order”/ “Spell Canceller”) will this actually stop the countdown, or is it too late to stop the countdown? \nA: When your opponent activates “Imperial Order” as a chain to your “Final Countdown,” the effect of “Final Countdown” is negated and you do not count turns. But when “Imperial Order” is activated after “Final Countdown” is activated, it is not negated because it is a Normal Spell Card and the count continues.   \n●Q: Would activating a second “Final Countdown” stop the countdown of the first one or would two separate counts be kept? \nA: Two separate counts would be kept.   \n● (Search for Final Countdown 2 to continue reading)",
