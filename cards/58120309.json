    "Edison": "How chains work:\n● When a card/effect is activated, the activator's opponent is the first to be able to add to the chain. If they decline, the activator can then add to the chain.\n● Road must be chained directly to the card/effect that would destroy 2+ cards you control. If Torrential Tribute is CL1, and Jar of Greed is CL2, Starlight Road cannot be CL3.\n● If you activate \"Heavy Storm\", and your opponent doesn't chain anything to Storm, and 2+ of your cards (excluding Storm itself) would be destroyed, you can chain this card.\n\nVs effects that might not destroy 2+ cards:\n● You can only activate Road if it is certain that 2+ cards you control would be destroyed.\n● Road can never be chained to the effect of \"Elemental HERO Stratos\". \n● Road can never be chained to the effect of \"Saber Slash\" (unless your opponent controls no face-up cards and you control at least 2 \"X-Saber\" monsters).\n● This can be activated even if the cards that would be destroyed are unaffected by card effects. If you control 2 “Tenkabito Shien”, and “Torrential Tribute” is activated, you can still activate this card.\n\nOn Summoning Stardust Dragon:\n● If the effect is not negated or the card is not destroyed, you can't Summon Stardust. \n● Cards which are in the Deck, GY, or Banished, can't be destroyed. If \"Heavy Storm\" is activated, and Road is chained, and \"Twister\" is chained, targeting Storm, Storm's effect will be negated by Road, but Stardust won't be Summoned (Storm wasn't destroyed by Road).\n● This card does not Synchro Summon. If Stardust Dragon summoned this way is later sent to the GY/banished, it can’t be Summoned again by any means.",

If you negate an effect with \"Starlight Road\" but cannot destroy the card, you cannot Special Summon \"Stardust Dragon\".\\n3. If you Chain “Starlight Road” to “Heavy Storm” while you control 2 or more Spell or Trap Cards and Special Summon\\n“Stardust Dragon” you cannot activate “Torrential Tribute” afterwards. Even though the effect of “Heavy Storm” is negated,\\nthe activation was not, so the card will still resolve without effect and you will miss the timing to activate “Torrential\\nTribute.”\\n4. If you control 2 face-up monsters including \"Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV6\" and your opponent activates \"Lightning Vortex\", you can activate \"Starlight Road\".\\n5. You can activate \"Starlight Road\" even if you cannot Special Summon due to the effect of \"Vanity's Fiend\".\\n6. You can activate \"Starlight Road\" even if you don't have a \"Stardust Dragon\" in your Extra Deck.\\n7. You cannot activate \"Starlight Road\" during the Damage Step.\\n8. You cannot Chain \"Starlight Road\" to the effect of \"Elemental HERO Stratos\" because it might not destroy any cards.\\n9. You cannot activate \"Starlight Road\" if your opponent activates \"Crush Card Virus\" while your only monsters are two face-down monsters with 1500 or more ATK.\\n10. Negating and destroying a card and Special Summoning \"Stardust Dragon\" do not happen at the same time. First you negate and destroy the card, then you Special Summon \"Stardust Dragon\". If you don't Special Summon, the effect of \"Starlight Road\" ends after negating and destroying the card.\\n11. You can Chain the effect of \"Royal Oppression\" to negate and destroy \"Starlight Road\".\\n12. Special Summoning \"Stardust Dragon\" with \"Starlight Road\" is not a Synchro Summon. If that \"Stardust Dragon\" is later sent to the GY, it cannot be Special Summoned by its own effect or \"Call of the Haunted\".\\n13. [FORUM] You cannot chain \"Starlight Road\" when your opponent targets your \"Call of the Haunted\" with \"Mystical Space Typhoon\" since \"Mystical Space Typhoon\" will only destroy \"Call of the Haunted\".  It is the effect of \"Call of the Haunted\" that will destroy the monster.\\n14. [FORUM] You can only activate \"Starlight Road\" if the effect that is activated will destroy 2 or more cards you control (per the card text). Even though \"Dark Hole\" has the potential to destroy up to 5 cards you control, if it is only destroying 1, you cannot activate \"Starlight Road\"."
