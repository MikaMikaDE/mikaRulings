    "Base": "1. The first sentence of this card is a maintenance cost, not an effect. It does not start a Chain.\\n2. \"Koa'ki Meiru Powerhand\" only negates a monster's effect while they are battling. This means that it only negates effects that activate on the field, or are continuous effects while on the field. Effects that activate in the GY like \"Sangan\" are not negated.\\n3. If \"Koa'ki Meiru Powerhand\" is destroyed by battle, its effect stops working from that point. Example: if \"Koa'ki Meiru Powerhand\" battles \"Divine Knight Ishzark\", the effect of \"Koa'ki Meiru Powerhand\" stops as soon as it is destroyed, and it will be removed from play by the effect of \"Divine Knight Ishzark\".\\n4. The effect negation ability of \"Koa'ki Meiru Powerhand\" begins when an attack target is declared. If \"Koa'ki Meiru Powerhand\" declares an attack on \"Cyber Valley\", and the controller of \"Cyber Valley\" removes it from play, \"Cyber Valley\" will be removed from play but the controller will not draw a card, and the Battle Phase will not end, because the effect was activated on the field and is negated by \"Koa'ki Meiru Powerhand\". (Also, since the number of potential attack targets has changed in this case, a replay will occur.)"
