It is also NOT applied when cards in your hand are removed from play by the effect of Lightforce Sword.\n●The effect of Magical Thorn is only applied when a card is discarded from your opponent’s hand to your opponent’s GY. So if they have your card in your hand by the effect of Exchange or Graverobber and they discard it, they don't take any damage from the effect of Magical Thorn.\n●If the opponent discards from their hand as a cost to activate a card like Cost Down and you chain Magical Thorn they won't take any damage. If your opponent activates a card where discarding is part of the effect of the card, such as Card Destruction, and you chain Magical Thorn, they WILL take damage because the effect of Magical Thorn will be active before the discarding effect resolves.\n●Magical Thorn deals damage per card, so if the opponent activates Graceful Charity they will take 1000 points of damage when they discard 2 cards. If they discard 5 cards to activate Final Destiny they take 2500 points of damage.\n●Even though Magical Thorn does damage per card discarded, it deals the damage as one lump sum for effects like Dark Room of Nightmare.\n●Necrovalley does not negate the effect of Magical Thorn.\n●The effect of Magical Thorn inflicts damage after an effect resolves. So if the effect of Morphing Jar is activated, the damage will be dealt after the new cards are drawn. This means if your opponent has 100 Life Points, and you have Magical Thorn active on the field but only one card left in your Deck, you will lose the Duel before the effect of Magical Thorn can deal damage to reduce your opponent’s Life Points to 0.\n●Magical Thorn will deal damage between steps in a chain. For example, both you and your opponent have 100 Life Points remaining, your opponent has two cards in their hand and you have Magical Thorn active on the field and a Set Mind Crush. It is your opponent’s turn and they activate Final Flame to deal 600 points of damage to you, and you chain Mind Crush calling the Sinister Serpent you know they have in their hand.
