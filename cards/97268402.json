If the targeted monster is no longer face-up on the field when the effect of \"Effect Veiler\" resolves, the targeted monster's effect(s) will not be negated.\\n4. If the effect of \"Effect Veiler\" resolves, and the targeted monster is then flipped face-down, its effect(s) will no longer be negated, even if it is flipped face-up again later that turn.\\n5.
