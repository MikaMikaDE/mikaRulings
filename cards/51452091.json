    "Base": "1. [FORUM] \"Royal Decree\" must be face-up to negate Trap Card effects.  Example: \"Royal Decree\" is face-up on the field and an attack is declared. \"Mirror Force\" is activated and \"Mystical Space Typhoon\" is chained, targeting \"Royal Decree\".  \"Mystical Space Typhoon\" destroys \"Royal Decree\". \"Mirror Force\" than resolves and destroys all Attack Position monsters your opponent controls. Since \"Royal Decree\" is no longer face-up when \"Mirror Force\" resolves, it will not negate the effect of \"Mirror Force\"."
