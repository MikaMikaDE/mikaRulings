The Patrician of Darkness’ controller must choose to direct the opponent's monster's attack to a monster under their own control. \n●  \n●Q: If there is more than one “Patrician of Darkness” on the field, does this create a non-attacking situation? \nA: No. Even if you have multiple Patrician of Darkness on your side of the field, the effect is not repeated. You will select a monster on your side of the field to be the monster your opponent will attack. \n●  \n●Q: Can “Patrician of Darkness” redirect a direct attack? \nA: In the case of Toons and “Jinzo#7” (and their kind), you can choose another monster or your LP. With Inaba White Rabbit, however, you cannot redirect it because of its effect. \n●bishop 02/23/04 \n●Q: Is the effect of “Patrician of Darkness” considered a targeting effect and would “Spirit Reaper” be destroyed if it is the monster selected for this effect? \nA: “Patrician of Darkness'” effect is not a targeting effect. “Spirit Reaper” will not be destroyed.
