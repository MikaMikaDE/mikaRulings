(“Monster Reborn,” “Call of the Haunted,” etc) \nA: The GY of a person controlling a Face-Up “Gravekeeper's Chief” is not affected by “Necrovalley.” Either player would be able to use card effects that would involve the GY of the player controlling the “Gravekeeper's Chief.” So if I have “Gravekeeper's Chief” face-up on my side of the field, my opponent could use “Monster Reborn” on a monster in my GY, but not their own GY. I could also use “Monster Reborn” on a monster in my GY, but not my opponent's GY.   \n●Q: If there are 2 “Gravekeeper’s Chief” on one side of the field while “Skill Drain” is applying and “Mystical Space Typhoon” targets “Skill Drain” what happens? \nA: After the Chain resolves you will have to choose one of the two “Gravekeeper's Chiefs” and send it to the GY.  12 /15 /2003",
