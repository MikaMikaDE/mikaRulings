If \"Vanity's Fiend\" or \"Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo\" are on the field, but \"Skill Drain\" is preventing their effects from blocking Special Summons, you can Summon \"Trap Eater\" even by sending \"Skill Drain\" to the GY.\\n2. You cannot Summon \"Trap Eater\" by sending \"Macro Cosmos\" to the GY, since \"Macro Cosmos\" will not allow cards to be sent to the GY. If \"Macro Cosmos\" and \"Imperial Iron Wall\" are both on the field, you cannot send \"Imperial Iron Wall\" to the GY to Summon \"Trap Eater\", but you can send \"Macro Cosmos\" to the GY to Summon \"Trap Eater\".\\n3. If \"Rivalry of Warlords\" is on the field but is being blocked by \"Royal Decree\", and you send \"Royal Decree\" to the GY to Summon \"Trap Eater\", the Summon will be successful. However, if you control another Type of monster besides that of \"Trap Eater\", then \"Trap Eater\" will be sent to the GY.\\n4. If you Summon \"Trap Eater\" by sending \"Royal Oppression\" to the GY, the effect of \"Royal Oppression\" cannot be used in response since it is no longer on the field."
