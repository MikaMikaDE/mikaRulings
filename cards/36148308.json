Once per turn, if a monster's battle position is changed (except during the Damage Step): You can target 1 card on the field; destroy it. If this card is sent from the Spell & Trap Zone to the GY: You can Tribute 1 \"Power Tool\" Synchro Monster; Special Summon 1 \"Life Stream Dragon\" from your Extra Deck. (This is treated as a Synchro Summon.)"
