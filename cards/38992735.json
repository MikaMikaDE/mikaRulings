    "Goat": "●Sending Wave-Motion Cannon to the GY is a cost, so when you send it to the GY, it's too late for your opponent to chain Mystical Space Typhoon, etc., to destroy Wave-Motion Cannon, because Wave-Motion Cannon is already in the GY.\n●Your opponent cannot chain Magic Jammer, or use Dark Paladin, etc., when you send Wave-Motion Cannon from the field to the GY. Your opponent CAN chain Magic Jammer or use Dark Paladin, etc., when you first activate Wave-Motion Cannon (meaning when you place it face-up on the field).\n●If Imperial Order is applying on the field, count Standby Phases as normal for Wave-Motion Cannon.\n●You can activate Wave-Motion Cannon (place it face-up on the field) and send it to the GY during the same turn, but it will not do any damage.\n●If the SP is skipped with Solomon's Lawbook or the turn is skipped with Gamble, increase the count for Wave-Motion Cannon anyway.\n●You cannot use Pyro Clock of Destiny with Wave-Motion Cannon. “Wave-Motion Cannon” counts the number of Standby Phases it was on the field when it is sent to the GY by its effect. \n●If “Imperial Order” is applying when “Wave Motion Cannon” sends itself to the GY, the effect of “Wave-Motion Cannon” is negated and no damage is inflicted.\n●Q: During MP 1, can “Wave-Motion Cannon” be sent to the GY for its effect prior to the opponent attempting to destroy it with a Set “Mystical Space Typhoon”? \nA: As the turn player you could claim priority and send the Wave Motion Cannon to the GY, to which the opponent can then respond. This would not be true if you were to activate another card's effect during your MP 1 first, like Raigeki for example, since they could then respond with their Mystical Space Typhoon in a chain to Raigeki and destroy the Wave Motion Cannon in the chain. The opponent would need to destroy your Wave Motion Cannon during your SP. \n●Q: If a “Wave-Motion Cannon” is on my field and I activate “Imperial Order” does it still get its counter during my SP. \nA: “Wave-Motion Cannon” does not use Counters. If “Imperial Order” is on the field, “Wave-Motion Cannon” will still get its phase count, but it does not use physical counters like other spell cards do. \n●Q: If “Imperial Order” were applying after “Wave-Motion Cannon” was activated, when “Imperial Order” leaves play, does the turn count return to 0? \nA: No, its count starts when it enters play and leaves when it leaves play. \n●Q: If I activate the effect of sending “Wave-Motion Cannon” to the GY to inflict damage to my opponent and my opponent activates “Imperial Order,” what happens? \nA: It would resolve without effect, meaning that it would go the GY but it would do no damage because “Imperial Order” negated its effect.
