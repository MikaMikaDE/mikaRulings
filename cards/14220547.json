If you Special Summon 1 Fusion Monster (and no other cards) by a Spell Card or effect (except during the Damage Step): You can target that monster; for the rest of this turn, it gains ATK equal to its original ATK, also it can only attack Attack Position monsters your opponent controls. You can only use each effect of \"Branded in Central Dogmatika\" once per turn."
