Player A only needs to reveal a DARK monster in hand. If they cannot, they discard their entire hand.\n●Example: Imperial Iron Wall was chained to Nobleman of Crossout, the targeted monster is destroyed but it is not removed from play. No cards in the Deck are removed from play.\n●Imperial Iron Wall trumps the effect of Macro Cosmos since it prevents an action.",
