If you take control of the target after its ATK is halved, it remains halved until the End Phase.\\n3. If you halve the ATK of a monster whose ATK was already halved by \"Blackwing - Gale the Whirlwind\", its ATK will become Â¼ of the original ATK. After the effect of \"Meklord Army of Granel\" is no longer applied, the ATK returns to the original ATK of the monster.\\n4. If a monster's ATK is being modified by Field/Equip/Continuous Spells and is halved by \"Meklord Army of Granel\", it will become half of its current value. When the effect of \"Meklord Army of Granel\" ends, it will return to the full value including all modifications from Field/Equip/Continuous Spells.\\n5. If \"Skill Drain\" is activated after the effect of \"Meklord Army of Granel\" resolves, the monster's ATK that was halved will remain halved until the End Phase."
