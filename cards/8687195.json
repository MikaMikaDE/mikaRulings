The monster you switch the opponent’s attack to must be a legal target. \n●Q: If I attack my opponent's face-down “Dreamsprite”, can they redirect my attack after it is flipped face-up? \nA: Dreamsprite's” effect is activated even if attacked while set. Steve Okegawa, 02/18/04 \n●Q: If “Dreamsprite” redirects an attack to “Suijin”, can “Suijin” use its effect to reduce the ATK of the monster to 0? \nA: Suijin’s effect could not be activated because it is no longer the target of an attack but the target of the effect of Dreamsprite.",
