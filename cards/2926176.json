You can use it against Spell/Trap cards like “Magic Jammer,” “Seven Tools of the Bandit,” “Solemn Judgment,” “Curse of Royal,” “Mystical Space Typhoon,” “Dust Tornado,” “Magic Drain,” and “Riryoku Field.” [It cannot be used against monster's effects] \n●Q: Player A attacks with a 4 star monster. Player B flips “Gravity Bind” Player A activates a set “Raigeki Break,” discards a card, and declares “Gravity Bind” as the target. Player B chains with “Curse of Royal” because “Raigeki Break” designated a Spell/Trap as the card to be destroyed. Can this be done? Is “Raigeki Break” a valid card for “Curse of Royal's” criteria? Nowhere does the text on “Raigeki Break”state it should specifically destroy 1 S/T, but it's very possible that the end result would be 1 S/T destroyed. \nA: If “Raigeki Break” targets a Spell/Trap card then “Curse of Royal” may be activated in response to negate its activation and destroy it. “Raigeki Break” does target one specific card. Since that card was a Trap Card, “Curse of Royal” was able to stop it.",
