If a monster is reduced to Level 1 while it's in your hand, you can reveal it for \"Wolf in Sheep's Clothing\" and Special Summon monsters of the same name from your Deck.\\n3. If \"Mystical Space Typhoon\" is Chained to \"Wolf in Sheep's Clothing\" and destroys that card that is changing the Level of your in-hand monster to 1, the effect to Special Summon will still resolve.\\n4. If you only have 1 Monster Card Zone open when this card resolves, you choose which of the two monsters to Special Summon, and the other one goes to your GY.\\n5. If an effect is Chained that removes the card you revealed from your hand, the effect to Special Summon will not be resolved.\\n6. You cannot activate \"Wolf in Sheep's Clothing\" if you don't have a monster in your Deck of the same name as a Level 1 monster in your hand.\\n7. The card you reveal is revealed until \"Wolf in Sheep's Clothing\" is completely resolved."
