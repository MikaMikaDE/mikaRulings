If multiple copies of Super Rejuvenation are activated in the same turn, you resolve each one at a time during the End Phase.\n●If Solemn Wishes is active, you will gain 500 for every card you draw. If you draw 3 cards then you gain 1500 Life Points.\n●You can't activate this card while your opponent controls Protector of the Sanctuary.\n●You can't activate this card in the Damage Step.\n●You can't activate this card after discarding for hand limit in the End Phase, as it is the very last action that occurs in a turn.\n●Cards / Effects can't activate beyond this point unless discarding triggers a mandatory effect. Only Counter Trap Cards and mandatory effects may activate in the resulting Chain.\n●Example: It is Player A's End Phase and they have a Set Divine Wrath from a  previous turn. Player A discards two copies of The White Stone of Legend to bring their hand size down to 6 cards. However, The White Stone of Legend has a mandatory Trigger Effect to add a Blue-Eyes White Dragon from the Deck to the hand, and Player B controls a Doomcaliber Knight. Thus, a chain is built with both The White Stone of Legend's effects forming a chain as Chain Links 1 and 2, and Doomcaliber Knight Tributing itself as Chain Link 3. Player A activates Divine Wrath as Chain Link 4 and discards a card as cost. When resolving the chain, Divine Wrath will successfully negate the effect of Doomcaliber Knight, then both effects of The White Stone of Legend will add a copy of Blue-Eyes White Dragon to Player A's hand (should any remain in the Deck). Once the chain has resolved, no chains may be built (unless mandatory Trigger/Trigger Effects were activated) and Player A must once again discard down to their hand limit and the turn ends.",
