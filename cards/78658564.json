[FORUM] \"It can't be changed\" means it can't be changed \"manually\". This is an example of where we're finally taking the \"training wheels\" off of some of the older cards. For any case where the battle position is irrevocably set in stone and cannot be changed, modified, or adjusted in any way, shape, or form by a manual charge or card effect, we'll say something like \"and remains in that battle position\" or such."
