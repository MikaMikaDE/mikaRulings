For example, if Change of Heart targets a monster equipped with Big Bang Shot, and Mystical Space Typhoon is chained to Change of Heart to destroy Big Bang Shot, first resolve Mystical Space Typhoon and destroy Big Bang Shot, then remove the monster that was equipped from play, and THEN resolve Change of Heart (and the effect of Change of Heart disappears).\n●If a monster equipped with Big Bang Shot is flipped face-down, it is no longer a target of Big Bang Shot so Big Bang Shot is sent to the GY and the monster is not removed from play.\n●When Imperial Order is active, and you destroy Big Bang Shot with Dust Tornado, the effect of Big Bang Shot that would remove the monster from play is NOT applied.\n●When you send Big Bang Shot to the GY with Emergency Provisions, the monster is removed from play at the same time.\n●When equipped to Guardian Ceal, if you send Big Bang Shot to the GY as a cost for Guardian Ceal's effect, Guardian Ceal is removed from play but Guardian Ceal's effect still resolves.\n●If a monster is equipped with Big Bang Shot and Fiber Jar is activated, both Big Bang Shot and the equipped monster are shuffled into the Deck, and the equipped monster is not removed from play even though Big Bang Shot was removed from the field.\n●If you equip your Big Bang Shot to your opponent's Dark Magician, and Dark Magician attacks your Giant Soldier of Stone, the opponent of the owner of the Big Bang Shot takes the damage (so your opponent, who attacked with Dark Magician, takes 900 points of damage.)\n●The battle damage caused when the equipped monster attacks a Defense Position monster is considered to come from the equipped monster, not from Big Bang Shot. So a Don Zaloog equipped with Big Bang Shot could still make the opponent discard 1 card when attacking a face-down monster with low DEF.\n●If you Special Summon a monster with Premature Burial, and equip it with Big Bang Shot, and Heavy Storm is activated, the effects of Premature Burial and Big Bang Shot form a chain, with the controller of the 2 cards determining the order in which they are placed on the chain, and the order in which they are resolved.
