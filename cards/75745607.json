You cannot activate anything prior to Drawing a card. Hino Kagu-Tsuchi is not activating prior to the Draw. It is resolving. In any case, the effect of Hino Kagu-Tsuchi will resolve but, quite frankly, doesn't even care if it is at the beginning of your DP. If your DP is skipped it will happen at the beginning of your SP. If your DP and your SP are skipped, it will happen at the beginning of your MP 1. And so on and so forth. \n●Q: If “Hino-Kagu-Tsuchi” inflicts Battle Damage, and later in the turn, “Skill Drain” is activated, will “Hino-Kagu-Tsuchi’s” effect be negated? \nA: No, when it dealt damage, that condition was met and they will discard. bishop 02/23/04",
