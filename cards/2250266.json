If you control 2 Attack Position 'Morphtronic' Staplens, their effects will prevent your opponent from attacking, except with a monster that has an effect to attack the opponent directly.\\n2. The effect to reduce a monster's ATK by 300 lasts for as long as that monster is face-up on the field.\\n3. If \"Shrink\" or \"Megamorph\" are applied to a monster whose ATK was reduced by 300 by this card's effect, that monster's ATK will be half or double its original ATK, minus 300.\\n4. The effect that changes your opponent's monster to Defense Position targets that monster."
