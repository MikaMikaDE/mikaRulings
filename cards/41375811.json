This card gains ATK and DEF equal to the ATK and DEF of all \"Zoodiac\" monsters attached to it as Materials. Once per turn: You can detach 1 Xyz Material from this card, then target 1 \"Zoodiac\" monster in your Graveyard; Special Summon it, but for the rest of this turn, it has its effects negated, also it cannot be used as an Xyz Material for a Summon."
