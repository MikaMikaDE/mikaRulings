    "Base": "1. Neither effect starts a Chain.\\n2. \"Dodger Dragon\" does not have to remain on the field for it to prevent the opponent from activating Counter Traps.\\n3. If \"Skill Drain\" was applied before \"Dodger Dragon\" is Summoned, the effect of \"Dodger Dragon\" is negated.\\n4. If \"Skill Drain\" is activated after \"Dodger Dragon\" is Summoned, it does not negate the effect of \"Dodger Dragon\".\\n5. [FORUM] \"Bottomless Trap Hole\" does not negate a Summon. It destroys and removes from play the monsters after it has already been successfully Summoned. Since \"Bottomless Trap Hole\" is not a Counter Trap Card, the effect of \"Dodger Dragon\" will not prevent your opponent from activating \"Bottomless Trap Hole\"."
