    "Base": "1. The first sentence of the effect is a condition, not an effect.\\n2. Tributing \"Infernity Mirage\" is a cost to activate its effect. The effect targets 2 'Infernity' monsters.\\n3. If you have 1 or more cards in your hand when this effect resolves, you will still Special Summon the targeted monsters.\\n4. If only 1 of the target monsters is in the GY when the effect of \"Infernity Mirage\" resolves, it will still be Special Summoned.\\n5. [FORUM] Since Tributing \"Infernity Mirage\" is a cost to activate its effect, it will not be on the field to be targeted by \"Effect Veiler\" if the opponent wanted to use \"Effect Veiler\" to negate \"Infernity Mirage\" after it has been activated."
