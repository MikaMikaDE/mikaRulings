    "Base": "When a Spell/Trap Card, or monster effect, is activated that includes an effect that Special Summons a monster(s): Return to the Extra Deck, 1 face-up Fusion Monster you control, or 2 Fusion Monsters in your GY, that mention \"Fallen of Albaz\" as material, and if you do, negate the activation, and if you do that, destroy that card. You can banish this card from your GY, then target 1 \"Branded\" Spell/Trap in your GY, except \"Branded Retribution\"; add it to your hand. You can only use 1 \"Branded Retribution\" effect per turn, and only once that turn."
