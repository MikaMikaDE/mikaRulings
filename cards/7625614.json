Just like two “Metasilver Armors” would create a lock against your opponent using effects that specifically target a monster. \n●  \n●Q: If I use two “Raregold Armors” (each on different monsters I control), would this mean that the opponent could attack me directly seeing as how he can't attack my monsters? A: No. With two “Raregold Armor” cards in play, the opponent could not attack your LP directly either.  12/12/03 \n●Q: If I have a “Marauding Captain” out, and “Raregold Armor” is equipped to ANOTHER warrior monster, does this create a non-attacking situation? \nA: Yes it would.
