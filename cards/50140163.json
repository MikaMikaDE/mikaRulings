    "Tengu": "Once per turn, during your Main Phase, if this card was Special Summoned by the effect of Allure Queen LV5, you can select 1 monster on your opponent's side of the field and equip it to this card. (Only 1 card at a time can be equipped due to this effect.) If this card would be destroyed by battle, the equipped monster is destroyed instead.\n●The (1) Ignition Effect activates & resolves on the field.\n●This effect targets a face-up monster on your opponent's field.\n●If Book of Moon is chained to the activation of Allure Queen LV7's effect to turn the Allure Queen face-down,the target is destroyed. It cannot be equipped to a face-down monster.\n●If “Allure Queen LV7” is flipped face-down after being Special Summoned by the effect of “Allure Queen LV5”, it is no longer treated as having been Special Summoned by “Allure Queen LV5”. So you can no longer use its first effect to equip it with a monster. (However, it is still considered to have been Special Summoned for effects like “Special Hurricane”.)\n●If “Allure Queen LV7” is Special Summoned by the effect of “Allure Queen LV5”, and is then temporarily removed from play with “Dimensionhole” or “Interdimensional Matter Transporter”, after it returns to the field it can still use its first effect. The fact that it was Special Summoned by “Allure Queen LV5” is not reset.\n●If “Allure Queen LV7” is Special Summoned by the effect of “Allure Queen LV5”, and is then permanently removed from play with “D.D. Warrior”, if it is later Special Summoned by an effect like “Return from the Different Dimension”, it is no longer treated as being Special Summoned by “Allure Queen LV5”. So it cannot use its first effect anymore.\n●The (2) Continuous Effect applies while this card is face-up on the field.\n●Applying this effect does not start a Chain.\n●The destroyed monster (that was equipped) is not considered to be destroyed by battle.",
