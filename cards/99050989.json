Injection Fairy Lily is a 400 attack monster at the time, so Drillago would not be to use its effect and declare a direct attack. Drillago decides to attack the Injection Fairy Lily. Even if the effect of the Injection Fairy Lily is activated in the Damage Step, Drillago will not be able to change to a direct attack. Drillago will continue battling with the Injection Fairy Lily and damage calculation will occur.",
