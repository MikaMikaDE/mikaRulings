    "Base": "1. The effect of \"Black Whirlwind\" starts a Chain. If an effect is chained, so that the Summoned 'Blackwing' monster is no longer face-up on the field when the effect of \"Black Whirlwind\" resolves, you cannot add a monster to your hand.\\n2. \"Black Whirlwind\" looks at the ATK of your newly-Summoned monster as it is on the field. If a Field Spell Card is increasing the monster's ATK, you can search your Deck for a 'Blackwing' monster that has less ATK than the increased ATK value.\\n3. If you control multiple copies of \"Black Whirlwind\", you can activate all of their effects. They form a single Chain, and you add 1 'Blackwing' to your hand as each one resolves.\\n4. If control of the Summoned 'Blackwing' monster shifts during or before resolution of \"Black Whirlwind\", you can still add a card to your hand because you can still see the ATK."
