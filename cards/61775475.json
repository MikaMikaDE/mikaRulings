(You can only banish each Attribute once per turn to activate this effect of \"Arms of Genex Return Zero\".) Once per turn: You can target up to 6 of your \"Genex\" monsters with different Attributes that are banished and/or in your GY; shuffle them into the Deck, then you can destroy up to that many cards in the Spell & Trap Zones."
