    "Base": "1. If you negate the effects of a monster with \"Majestic Star Dragon\" you can only activate 1 of the monster's effects 1 time.\\n2. The effect to return \"Majestic Star Dragon\" to the Extra Deck is mandatory. It activates even if an effect that prohibits Special Summons is applied. In that case, you return \"Majestic Star Dragon\" to the Extra Deck but will not Special Summon \"Stardust Dragon\".\\n3. If \"G.B. Hunter\" is on the field, the effect to return \"Majestic Star Dragon\" to the Extra Deck will activate and resolve without effect.\\n4. If you activate the effect of the monster that \"Majestic Star Dragon\" negated it will start a Chain. \"Divine Wrath\" can be used against this effect and will destroy \"Majestic Star Dragon\" in this case.\\n5. The effect to Special Summon \"Stardust Dragon\" targets the \"Stardust Dragon\". It activates even if there is no \"Stardust Dragon\" in the GY.\\n6. If you negate the effect of a monster and then take control of that monster with another effect, the monster's effect is still negated.\\n7. If you negate your opponent's \"Majestic Star Dragon\" with your own, you can activate the effect once again to negate another monster.\\n8. You cannot gain and activate the effect of a Gladiator Beast that returns to the Main Deck, but you can gain and activate the effect of a Gladiator Beast that returns to the Extra Deck.\\n9. If \"Majestic Star Dragon\" is destroyed by battle, it cannot activate the effects of monsters like \"Hyper Hammerhead\".\\n10. If you negate \"The Six Samurai - Yaichi\" you cannot apply the effect to destroy another 'Six Samurai' instead if \"Majestic Star Dragon\" would be destroyed.\\n11. If you negate \"Morphtronic Celfon\" you can only activate one of its effects, corresponding to the battle position of \"Majestic Star Dragon\".\\n12. If you negate the effect of a Gemini monster that is being treated as a Normal Monster, you cannot activate its effect. If you negate the effect of a Gemini monster after it's been Normal Summoned again, you cannot activate the negated effect because \"Majestic Star Dragon\" cannot be Summoned twice.\\n13. If you negate a card with an Ignition Effect like \"Exiled Force\" you can use its effect.\\n14. If you negate \"Sangan\" with \"Majestic Star Dragon\" you cannot activate its effect if \"Majestic Star Dragon\" is sent to the GY.\\n15. You must pay all costs and meet all conditions required for the negated effect that you want to activate with \"Majestic Star Dragon\".\\n16. You can only activate the negated effect during the turn you negated it with \"Majestic Star Dragon\".\\n17. \"Majestic Star Dragon\" can activate effects that start a Chain. Ignition, Quick, and Trigger Effects can all be activated, but Continuous Effects that are always applied cannot be applied by \"Majestic Star Dragon\".\\n18. If you negate \"Sangan\" with \"Majestic Star Dragon\" and then attack it, the effect of \"Sangan\" will activate and resolve normally.\\n19. \"Majestic Star Dragon\" cannot negate the effect of a monster whose effect is already being negated.\\n20. You can Tribute \"Majestic Star Dragon\" to negate an opponent's card even if they control no cards to be destroyed.\\n21. You can use \"Stardust Dragon\" as a Synchro Material Monster for \"Majestic Star Dragon\" even if it's being treated as a Tuner.\\n22. You can Summon \"Majestic Star Dragon\" if \"Majestic Dragon\" is being treated as a non-Tuner and \"Stardust Dragon\" is being treated as a Tuner."
