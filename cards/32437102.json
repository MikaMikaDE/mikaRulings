    "Goat": "● If “DNA Surgery” was applying on the field and Warrior was declared, can a monster be equipped with “Dragonic Attack” and would its effect be allowed to resolve? \nA: The most recent change of the monster's Type will remain in effect. The Warrior would become a Dragon monster by the effect of Dragonic Attack and would remain a Dragon monster because Dragonic Attack was the most recent change to the monster's Type. \n●Q: If “Dragonic Attack” is equipped to a Warrior monster changing it to Dragon, would “Lord of D.” negate the effect of “Dragonic Attack” and destroy it? \nA: The effect of Dragonic Attack would still be applied. Lord of D. has no affect on effects that targeted a Dragon monster before Lord of D. was on the field. This would include the Warrior that becomes a Dragon because of Dragonic Attack.",
