It is not a cost to activate this effect.\\n2. This effect targets 1 Spell or Trap Card your opponent controls.\\n3.

See \"Jain, Lightsworn Paladin\" for additional rulings.\\n6. [FORUM] Unless the effect of \"Lyla, Lightsworn Sorceress\" is negated, it's effect will still resolve as long as it can still switch itself to Defense Position. For example, if the effect of \"Lyla, Lightsworn Sorceress\" is activated and \"Enemy Controller\" is chained to take control of \"Lyla, Lightsworn Sorceress\", \"Lyla, Lightsworn Sorceress\" will change to the opponent's side of the field and then switch to Defense Position and destroy \"Enemy Controller\", since \"Enemy Controller\" is not sent to the GY until the chain fully resolves."
