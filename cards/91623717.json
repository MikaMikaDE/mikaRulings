However, no further copies of \"Chain Strike\" can be activated in that same chain after that.\\n2. [FORUM] If the effect of \"Chain Strike\" reduces a player's Life Points to 0 in the middle of a Chain, the game ends before the rest of the Chain resolves. Example: Player A has 500 Life Points and plays \"Aegis of Gaia\". Player B chains \"Chain Strike\".  After \"Chain Strike\" resolves, the game ends.  \"Aegis of Gaia\" does not resolve and Player A does not gain 3000 Life Points."
