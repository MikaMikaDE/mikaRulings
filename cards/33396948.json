If so, the answer is yes. Example: Player A activates “Confiscation.” In response, Player B chains by activating “Back-up Soldier.” Player B has 2 pieces of Exodia (including the head) in his/her hand, and the other 3 pieces of Exodia are in his/her GY. The chain looks like this: Chain Link 1: Player A's “Confiscation” activated. Chain Link 2: Player B's “Back-up Soldier” activated. Assuming that no other cards are added to the chain, it will resolve like this: Chain Link 2 Resolution: Player B's “Back-up Soldier” resolves, and the remaining 3 pieces of Exodia are added to Player B's hand. Stop right there. All 5 pieces of Exodia are now in Player B's hand, and the win can be declared at that point, before Chain Link 1 gets the chance to resolve. The reasoning behind this is that an Exodia win CAN be declared during a Chain, after one effect resolves and before another begins. However, an Exodia win CANNOT be declared while an effect is still happening. An example is the infamous Exodia/Graceful Charity situation: You have 2 Exodia pieces in your hand along with “Graceful Charity” and nothing else. You play “Graceful Charity,” and draw the last 3 pieces of Exodia. However, the win CANNOT be declared, as you must fully resolve the current effect first. However, that requires you to discard 2 cards in your hand, so the Exodia win will not happen. Steve Okegawa, \n●Q: If the last piece of “Exodia the Forbidden One” is drawn from the Deck and the opponent activates “Drop Off”, will the player still receive the automatic win? \nA: If a player draws the last piece of Exodia, that player wins before the effect of Drop Off resolves.",
