    "Base": "1. When you end the Battle Phase with \"Battle Fader\" the game moves to the End Step of the Battle Phase.\\n2. If you cannot Special Summon \"Battle Fader\" then the effect to end the Battle Phase cannot be applied.\\n3. When you resolve the effect of \"Battle Fader\" you Special Summon \"Battle Fader\" and then end the Battle Phase.\\n4. \"Torrential Tribute\" cannot be activated because ending the Battle Phase is the last thing to happen.\\n5. You can activate the effect of \"Battle Fader\" when your opponent attacks directly with a monster like \"Earthbound Immortal Ccapac Apu\" even if you control monsters.\\n6. [FORUM] The effect of \"Battle Fader\" is activated during the Battle Step and not the Damage Step, therefore you will be able to activate the effect of \"Royal Oppression\" to negate the Special Summon of \"Battle Fader\".\\n7. [FORUM] \"Battle Fader\" has the same timing as cards like \"Mirror Force\", \"Sakuretsu Armor\", and \"Magic Cylinder\". This means you have one opportunity to activate it, the initial chain in direct response to the attack declaration. If you allow a chain to resolve, such as \"Battle Fader\" > \"Royal Oppression\", you will not be able to activate a 2nd copy of \"Battle Fader\".\\n8. [FORUM] \"Battle Fader\" has a Trigger Effect, so you would be unable to activate multiple copies of \"Battle Fader\" in response to the same attack declaration.\\n9. [FORUM] Since \"Battle Fader\" has a Trigger effect, it must be activated as soon as the Trigger condition occurs. If a direct attack is made while \"Light and Darkness Dragon\" is on the field, \"Battle Fader\" will have to be Chain link 1. The effect of \"Light and Darkness Dragon\" will be Chain link 2. You may then activate \"Mirror Force\" as Chain link 3."
