Special Summoning the removed from play monster is mandatory, does not target, starts a Chain, and can activate during the Damage Step.\\n3. If you remove from play a monster that cannot be Special Summoned, like \"Overdrive Teleporter\", with the first effect, it will not be Special Summoned when the second effect resolves.\\n4. If \"Silent Psychic Wizard\" is flipped face-down or removed from play temporarily, and then sent from the field to the GY, the effect to Special Summon still activates."
