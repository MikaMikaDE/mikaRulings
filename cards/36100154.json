    "Base": "1. The effect to gain ATK does not start a Chain.\\n2. This card only applies to its controller's monsters, not the opponent's.\\n3. Even you have multiple copies of \"Amazoness Fighting Spirit\" in play, your monster will still only gain 1000 ATK.\\n4. If you attack your opponent's monster that has less ATK than your 'Amazoness' monster and they activate \"Honest\", your 'Amazoness' monster will gain 1000 ATK during damage calculation.\\n5. If you attack your opponent's monster that has more ATK than your 'Amazoness' monster, it will gain 1000 ATK automatically at the start of Damage Calculation. If your opponent then activates \"Honest\", it will calculate the bonus based on the ATK of your monster after the 1000 ATK is added."
