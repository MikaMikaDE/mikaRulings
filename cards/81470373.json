You cannot Special Summon monsters from the Extra Deck for the rest of this turn, except DARK monsters. You can only use this effect of \"Blackwing - Simoon the Poison Wind\" once per turn. During the End Phase, send the \"Black Whirlwind\" placed by this effect to the GY, and if you do, take 1000 damage."
