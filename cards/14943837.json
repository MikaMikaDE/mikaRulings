    "Base": "1. The effect of \"Debris Dragon\" is a Trigger Effect that activates when it is Summoned and targets 1 monster in the GY. \"Debris Dragon\" does not continue to target that monster after the other monster is Special Summoned.\\n2. All restrictions on \"Debris Dragon\" and Synchro Summons are conditions, not effects, so will not be negated by \"Skill Drain\".\\n3. If \"Debris Dragon\" Special Summons a Gemini Monster, the Gemini Monster's effect that makes it a Normal Monster is negated, so the Gemini Monster is considered an Effect Monster.\\n4. You cannot use \"DNA Surgery\", naming Dragons, to use \"Debris Dragon\" to Synchro Summon a non-Dragon Synchro Monster. The Synchro Monster must originally be a Dragon-Type monster."
