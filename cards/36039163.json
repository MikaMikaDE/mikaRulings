    "Goat": "● If you activate “Fiend Comedian ” and you call it wrong and “Penguin Knight” goes to the GY because of it, will its effect activate? \nA: No. Penguin Knight's effect only activates when it is sent from your Deck to the GY by an opponent’s card effect. If your own Fiend Comedian causes it to be sent to the GY, its effect won't trigger. ",
