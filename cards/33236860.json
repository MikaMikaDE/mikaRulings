    "Base": "1. You can Special Summon \"Blackwing - Silverwind the Ascendant\" with the effect of \"Blackwing - Vayu the Emblem of Honor\". You will need to remove from play a Level 7 'Blackwing' monster to do so.\\n2. You can activate the effect to destroy monsters when this card is Synchro Summoned even if \"Skill Drain\" is active. If you do, you will not be able to conduct your Battle Phase, even though the effect is negated.\\n3. If a monster targeted by \"Blackwing - Silverwind the Ascendant\" gains more DEF than the ATK of \"Blackwing - Silverwind the Ascendant\", it will not be destroyed by this card's effect.\\n4. If any monster targeted by this effect is flipped face-down, it will not be destroyed. Any remaining face-up targets will be destroyed.\\n5. If this card is flipped face-down its ATK cannot be verified, so no monsters will be destroyed.\\n6. You don't choose when to use the 'next time a 'Blackwing' monster would be destroyed by battle' effect. It is automatically activated the next time your 'Blackwing' monster would be destroyed by battle during your opponent's turn."
