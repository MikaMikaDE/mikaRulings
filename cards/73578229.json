    "Tengu": "(1) The face-up monster(s) with the highest ATK on the field is unaffected by the effects of Spell Cards. (2) When Pole Position is removed from the field, destroy the face-up monster(s) with the highest ATK on the field.\n●The (1) Continuous-like Effect does not start a chain.\n●The (1) Continuous-like Effect can become responsible for voluntary and involuntary infinite loops. Any voluntary action  that would result in an infinite loop is simply an illegal action that players CANNOT perform. If an involuntary action (such as drawing a card during your Draw Phase) creates an infinite loop, the card responsible for the loop is destroyed by game mechanics.\n●Example 1: Player A has a Gemini Elf, a Luminous Spark and a Pole Position face-up on the field. Since Gemini Elf is the monster on the field with the highest ATK, it is unaffected by Spell Cards. If Player B Summons X-Head Cannon, Luminous Spark will raise its ATK to 2300, making it the highest ATK monster on the field and causing it to become unaffected by Spell Cards, reducing its ATK to 1800, only for Luminous Spark's effect to once again increase its ATK to 2300, and so on. This voluntary action by Player B (Summoning X-Head Cannon) would create a voluntary infinite loop. Thus, Player B cannot Summon X-Head Cannon.\n●Example 2: Player A has a Gemini Elf and an Opticlops equipped with an Axe of Despair face-up on the field, as well as a Set Ring of Destruction. Player B has a Blue-Eyes White Dragon and a Pole Position face-up on the field. If Player A activates Ring of Destruction to destroy Player B's Blue-Eyes White Dragon, then Opticlops would become the monster with the highest ATK on the field, causing it to become unaffected by Spell Cards (including the equipped Axe of Despair) and thus it will cease to be the monster with the highest ATK on the field and the effect of Axe of Despair will once again apply and raise its ATK, and so on. Therefore, Player A cannot target Player B's Blue-Eyes White Dragon with Ring of Destruction as resolving that card would create a voluntary infinite loop.\n●Example 3: Player A has a face-up Opticlops and a face-up Gemini Elf. Player B has a Set Pole Position and no other cards. Player A activates Axe of Despair, selecting Opticlops as the target. If Player B voluntarily chains Pole Position, it will create a voluntary infinite loop upon the resolution of Pole Position and Axe of Despair. Therefore, Player B cannot chain Pole Position, nor can they activate it while those are the only face-up monsters on the field while Axe of Despair remains equipped.\n●Example 4: Player A has a Pole Position and an Opticlops face-up on the field. Player B has a Muka Muka equipped with an Axe of Despair face-up on the field with no cards in his hand. Player B draws a card at the start of his turn, making Muka Muka's ATK rise to 1900. Since Muka Muka is now the monster on the field with the highest ATK, it becomes unaffected by the effects of Spell Cards. But once unaffected by the effects of Spell Cards, Muka Muka no longer has the highest ATK on the field. An involuntary infinite loop has been created by an action that could not be avoided. Therefore, Pole Position is destroyed by game mechanics.\n●The (2) Continuous-like Effect does NOT start a chain. The monster is destroyed simultaneously with Pole Position being removed from the field.",
    "Goat": "●The second effect of Pole Position does not begin a chain. When Pole Position is removed from the field, the effect is applied immediately and the monster is destroyed.\n●If Pole Position is applying, and your opponent controls Blue-Eyes White Dragon and Skull Servant, and you activate Smashing Ground, Blue-Eyes White Dragon is unaffected by Spell Cards, so the effect of Smashing Ground disappears.\n●If you control Dark Magician and your opponent controls Blue-Eyes White Dragon, and you activate Flint targeting Blue-Eyes White Dragon, and your opponent chains Pole Position, then Flint is equipped meaninglessly to Blue-Eyes White Dragon. If Blue-Eyes White Dragon is destroyed, Flint can be equipped to Dark Magician meaninglessly if you choose (even if other monsters are on the field).\n●If Lv Limit - Area B and Pole Position are on the field, the highest ATK monster is unaffected by Lv Limit - Area B. If it attacks, and during damage calculation Mask of Weakness is activated to reduce its ATK so that it is no longer the highest ATK monster on the field, the effect of Lv Limit - Area B is applied. Also, the attack stops. Do not perform damage calculation.\n●You cannot choose to Summon a monster, Set a monster, or Set or activate a Spell/Trap Card, or card effect, if it would cause an infinite loop. If you do this by mistake, just rewind the game to before the Summon/Set/activation occurred.\n●If an infinite loop is caused because of game mechanics and not by a player’s voluntary card play, “Pole Position” will be destroyed.

If the opponent Summons 'X-Head Cannon' (1800 ATK / LIGHT), “Luminous Spark” will raise the ATK of “X-Head Cannon” to 2300, making it the highest ATK monster on the field, so it’s unaffected by Spell Cards, so it drops to 1800 ATK, then increases to 2300, then drops to 1800, etc. This would create an infinite loop. Therefore, the opponent can't Summon “X-Head Cannon”. \n● EXAMPLE #2 The opponent has 'Blue-Eyes White Dragon' (3000 ATK) and “Pole Position” applying. I have 'Gemini Elf' (1900 ATK), and an 'Opticlops' (1800 ATK) equipped with 'Axe of Despair'(+1000 ATK; 2800 total) applying, and a Set 'Ring of Destruction'. If I activate 'Ring of Destruction' to destroy 'Blue-Eyes White Dragon', then “Opticlops” will be the highest ATK monster on the field, and cause an infinite loop (it is the highest, it isn’t, it is, it isn’t, etc.). Therefore, I can't target “Blue-Eyes White Dragon” with “Ring of Destruction”. \n● EXAMPLE #3 The opponent has a face-down 'Pole Position'. I have 'Opticlops' (1800 ATK) and 'Gemini Elf' (1900 ATK) applying. I activate 'Axe of Despair' (+1000 ATK) and try to equip my 'Opticlops' (1800 ATK). The opponent can't chain 'Pole Position', since that would cause an infinite loop. “Pole Position” is an illegal activation. Put it back face-down. \n● EXAMPLE #4 I have 'Pole Position', 'Blade Knight' (1600 ATK / LIGHT), and 'Luminous Spark' (+500 ATK to LIGHT) applying and 2 cards in my hand. The opponent has 'Giant Orc' (2200 ATK / EARTH) applying, which is the highest-ATK monster on the field. If I Set 1 of the 2 cards in my hand, “Blade Knight” gains +400 ATK with its effect, becomes the highest-ATK monster, and because of “Luminous Spark” an infinite loop is created. So I am not allowed to Set a card. \n● If an infinite loop is caused because of game mechanics and not by a player’s voluntary card play, “Pole Position” will be destroyed. When “Pole Position” is destroyed in this way, no monster on the field is destroyed by the effect of 'Pole Position'.\n● EXAMPLE #5 I have 'Pole Position' and 'Opticlops' (1800 ATK) applying. The opponent has a 'Muka Muka' equipped with 'Axe of Despair' applying with no cards in his hand. At the start of the opponent's turn, he draws a card, making 'Muka Muka's ATK 1900. An infinite loop is created by something that could not be avoided, so “Pole Position” is destroyed. \n● EXAMPLE #6 The opponent has “Blade Knight” (1600 ATK) equipped with “Butterfly Dagger - Elma” (+300 ATK; 1900 ATK total) and 2 cards in hand, along with “Marauding Captain” (1200 ATK). The turn player has “Robbin’ Goblin”, “Pole Position”, and “Giant Orc” (2200 ATK). The turn player attacks “Marauding Captain” with “Giant Orc”, inflicting 1000 damage. The opponent has to discard a card because of “Robbin’ Goblin” and an infinite loop is created because “Blade Knight” now fluctuates between 2300 and 2000 ATK (either above or below “Giant Orc”, making it the strongest monster on the field… or not). Therefore, “Pole Position” is destroyed. \n● EXAMPLE #7 I have 'Pole Position', 'Banner of Courage', and 'Opticlops' applying. The opponent has 'Gemini Elf' applying. When I enter my Battle Phase, an infinite loop is created as “Opticlops” fluctuates between 1800 and 2000 ATK.

If the opponent Summons 'X-Head Cannon' (1800 ATK / LIGHT), “Luminous Spark” will raise the ATK of “X-Head Cannon” to 2300, making it the highest ATK monster on the field, so it’s unaffected by Spell Cards, so it drops to 1800 ATK, then increases to 2300, then drops to 1800, etc. This would create an infinite loop. Therefore, the opponent can't Summon “X-Head Cannon”. \n● EXAMPLE #2 The opponent has 'Blue-Eyes White Dragon' (3000 ATK) and “Pole Position” applying. I have 'Gemini Elf' (1900 ATK), and an 'Opticlops' (1800 ATK) equipped with 'Axe of Despair'(+1000 ATK; 2800 total) applying, and a Set 'Ring of Destruction'. If I activate 'Ring of Destruction' to destroy 'Blue-Eyes White Dragon', then “Opticlops” will be the highest ATK monster on the field, and cause an infinite loop (it is the highest, it isn’t, it is, it isn’t, etc.). Therefore, I can't target “Blue-Eyes White Dragon” with “Ring of Destruction”. \n● EXAMPLE #3 The opponent has a face-down 'Pole Position'. I have 'Opticlops' (1800 ATK) and 'Gemini Elf' (1900 ATK) applying. I activate 'Axe of Despair' (+1000 ATK) and try to equip my 'Opticlops' (1800 ATK). The opponent can't chain 'Pole Position', since that would cause an infinite loop. “Pole Position” is an illegal activation. Put it back face-down. \n● EXAMPLE #4 I have 'Pole Position', 'Blade Knight' (1600 ATK / LIGHT), and 'Luminous Spark' (+500 ATK to LIGHT) applying and 2 cards in my hand. The opponent has 'Giant Orc' (2200 ATK / EARTH) applying, which is the highest-ATK monster on the field. If I Set 1 of the 2 cards in my hand, “Blade Knight” gains +400 ATK with its effect, becomes the highest-ATK monster, and because of “Luminous Spark” an infinite loop is created. So I am not allowed to Set a card. \n● If an infinite loop is caused because of game mechanics and not by a player’s voluntary card play, “Pole Position” will be destroyed. When “Pole Position” is destroyed in this way, no monster on the field is destroyed by the effect of 'Pole Position'.\n● EXAMPLE #5 I have 'Pole Position' and 'Opticlops' (1800 ATK) applying. The opponent has a 'Muka Muka' equipped with 'Axe of Despair' applying with no cards in his hand. At the start of the opponent's turn, he draws a card, making 'Muka Muka's ATK 1900. An infinite loop is created by something that could not be avoided, so “Pole Position” is destroyed. \n● EXAMPLE #6 The opponent has “Blade Knight” (1600 ATK) equipped with “Butterfly Dagger - Elma” (+300 ATK; 1900 ATK total) and 2 cards in hand, along with “Marauding Captain” (1200 ATK). The turn player has “Robbin’ Goblin”, “Pole Position”, and “Giant Orc” (2200 ATK). The turn player attacks “Marauding Captain” with “Giant Orc”, inflicting 1000 damage. The opponent has to discard a card because of “Robbin’ Goblin” and an infinite loop is created because “Blade Knight” now fluctuates between 2300 and 2000 ATK (either above or below “Giant Orc”, making it the strongest monster on the field… or not). Therefore, “Pole Position” is destroyed. \n● EXAMPLE #7 I have 'Pole Position', 'Banner of Courage', and 'Opticlops' applying. The opponent has 'Gemini Elf' applying. When I enter my Battle Phase, an infinite loop is created as “Opticlops” fluctuates between 1800 and 2000 ATK. So “Pole Position” is destroyed. \n● EXAMPLE #8 I have 'Pole Position', 'Gemini Elf' (1900 ATK / EARTH) and 'Mystic Plasma Zone' (+500 ATK to DARK) applying, and an 'Opticlops' (1800 ATK / DARK) in face-down Defense Position. The opponent attacks my face-down 'Opticlops' with 'Mokey Mokey'. When we flip 'Opticlops' face-up in the Damage Step, an infinite loop is created as “Opticlops” fluctuates between 1800 and 2300 ATK (either above or below “Gemini Elf”, making it the strongest monster on the field, or not). Therefore, “Pole Position” is destroyed.",

When 'Pole Position' leaves the field, the effect is applied immediately and the monster is destroyed.\n● If 'Pole Position' is applying, and your opponent controls 'Blue-Eyes White Dragon' and 'Skull Servant', and you activate 'Smashing Ground', 'Blue-Eyes White Dragon' is unaffected by Spell Cards, so the effect of 'Smashing Ground' disappears.\n● If you control 'Dark Magician' and your opponent controls 'Blue-Eyes White Dragon', and you activate 'Flint' targeting 'Blue-Eyes White Dragon', and your opponent chains 'Pole Position', then 'Flint' is equipped meaninglessly to 'Blue-Eyes White Dragon'.
