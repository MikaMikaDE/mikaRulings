    "Base": "1. Gemini monsters that are treated as Normal Monsters on the field cannot be Normal Summoned again to switch on their effects. You cannot Summon a Gemini monster from your hand while \"Heat Wave\" is applied.\\n2. You can activate \"Embodiment of Apophis\" while \"Heat Wave\" is active, but not \"Zoma the Spirit\" because \"Zoma the Spirit\" is treated as an Effect Monster.\\n3. You can Summon Tokens with \"Scapegoat\" while \"Heat Wave\" is active. (Tokens are treated as Normal Monsters.)\\n4. You cannot target an Effect Monster with \"Call of the Haunted\" or \"The Shallow Grave\" while \"Heat Wave\" is active.\\n5. You can activate \"Polymerization\" or a Ritual Spell Card to Special Summon a non-Effect Fusion or Ritual Monster like \"Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon\" or \"Black Luster Soldier\".\\n6. You can activate \"Starlight Road\" while the effect of \"Heat Wave\" is being applied, but you cannot Special Summon a \"Stardust Dragon\".\\n7. You can activate the effect of \"Drill Warrior\" to remove itself from play while \"Heat Wave\" is in effect.\\n8. A \"Drill Warrior\" that is already removed from play will still activate its effect to Special Summon itself even if \"Heat Wave\" is active, but since you can't Special Summon it will remain removed from play and will not try to Summon itself again.\\n9. If you skip your Draw Phase with \"Reckless Greed\" while \"Heat Wave\" is in effect, the effect of \"Heat Wave\" will still wear off at the point your Draw Phase would have occurred. You cannot use \"Reckless Greed\" to make the effect of \"Heat Wave\" last for extra turns."
