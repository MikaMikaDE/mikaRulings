If you Normal Summon \"Necroface\" while \"Future Visions\" is face-up and activate the effect of \"Necroface\" as Chain Link 1, \"Necroface\" will return itself to the Deck. After the Chain has resolved, the effect of \"Necroface\" to remove cards from the Deck will activate since \"Necroface\" had been removed from play by \"Future Visions\".\\n3. The controller of each monster removed by \"Future Visions\" decides which Monster Card Zone it will be placed in when it returns.\\n4. The controller of the monster(s) removed by \"Future Visions\" decides when during their Standby Phase they will activate the effect to return the monster(s) to the field.\\n5. If more than one monster is removed by the effect of \"Future Visions\" they are all returned to the field at the same time.\\n6. If 2 of your monsters are removed from play by \"Future Visions\" but during the Standby Phase you have only 1 open Monster Card Zone, you choose 1 monster to return to the field and send the other monster to the GY.\\n7. If you have \"Future Visions\" face-up on the field and it removes one of your monsters from play, if your opponent activates his own \"Future Visions\" your monster will remain removed from play. (\"Future Visions\" #1 is not \"Future Visions\" #2.)\\n8. If \"Book of Moon\" is Chained to the effect of \"Future Visions\" the monster will still be removed from play.\\n9. Both effects of \"Future Visions\" start a Chain."
