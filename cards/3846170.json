However, you must still attack with 1 monster.\n\n● If in defense position, having its effect negated, or summoned after the battle phase, the \"This card must attack if able\" clause does nothing this turn.\n\n● The effect to change battle position starts a chain when the attack is declared and can be negated by \"Divine Wrath\".\n\n● The effect to switch battle position can be chained to with cards like \"Mirror Force\". Even if the attacking monster is destroyed or otherwise prevented from reaching the damage step, the effect to switch battle position resolves normally.\n\n● If \"Book of Moon\" is Chained to the effect to change this card's battle position, it will change from face-down Defense Position to face-up Attack Position.",
