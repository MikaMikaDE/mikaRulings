If Penguin Soldier targets TWO monsters then it does specifically designate a target but it does NOT specifically designate 1 target. So specifically designate 1 target (Chaos Command Magician, Metasilver Armor, Curse of Royal) is different from specifically designate a target (Lord of D., Freed the Matchless General, Tyrant Dragon, etc.). \n●Q: If “Exchange” is used to get an opponent's card (and vice versa) from their hand, and it is played on the field, when a “Penguin Soldier” is flipped and targets the Exchanged card... where would it go? To the ORIGINAL owner, or the one who played it after Exchange? \nA: The card will return to the hand of the Owner of the card. ",
