It cannot be activated during the Damage Step.\\n3. None of these effects are simultaneous. You send 1 'Scrap' monster to the GY, then, if you did, you draw a card.\\n4. Afterwards, you destroy the selected monster.\\n5. Even if the targeted monster is no longer face-up on the field when \"Scrapstorm\" resolves, you still send a 'Scrap' monster to the GY and draw a card.\\n6. If the target monster is face-down when this effect resolves, it is still destroyed."
