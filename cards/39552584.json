You can only use this effect of \"Grapha, Dragon Overlord of Dark World\" once per turn. If this Fusion Summoned card in its owner's control leaves the field because of an opponent's card: You can Special Summon 1 of your \"Grapha, Dragon Lord of Dark World\" that is banished or in your GY, then each player with a hand discards 1 card."
