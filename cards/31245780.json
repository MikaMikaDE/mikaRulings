If the first monster that attacked directly is face-down when \"Confusion Chaff\" resolves, it is flipped face-up and damage calculation is conducted normally.\\n5. If a monster's attack becomes a direct attack due to a replay, it is still considered to be the first monster that attacked directly for \"Confusion Chaff\".\\n6. If a monster declares a direct attack, but that attack is negated, it will not be considered the first monster that attacked directly that turn.\\n7. If your \"Amazoness Swords Woman\" declares the second direct attack during a Battle Phase, and \"Confusion Chaff\" is activated, your opponent will take any battle damage from that battle."
