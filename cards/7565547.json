Steve Okegawa, 12/05/2003\n●Q: Does “Collected Power” bring “United We Stand” and/or “Mage Power” to my side of the field. Do they power up my monster or is there no affect since I'm not the owner of the cards? \nA: They will remain on the side of the field belonging to the person who played them. Treat this like what occurs when you use “Change of Heart” on a monster equipped with either of those two cards.\n●Q: Can Collected Power be used to re-equip multiple Union monsters to the same monster at once? \nA: The card text states that it can only be equipped with one monster at a time, besides Union monsters only affect their appropriate counterparts as listed on the card itself.  12/10/03",
