    "Tengu": "● The effect to perform an extra normal summon is a continuous effect and can be stopped with cards such as \"Effect Veiler\", \"Fiendish Chain\" and \"Skill Drain\".\n\n● If this card is in attack position before the battle phase, you must enter the battle phase, even if it cannot attack due to cards like \"Swords of Revealing Light\" or \"Gravity Bind\".\n\n● During the battle phase, you must attack with this card before entering main phase 2 or end phase, unless it cannot attack due to cards like \"Swords of Revealing Light\" or \"Gravity Bind\".\n\n● If a replay occurs when this card attacks, you choose which opposing monster to attack but do not have the option of not attacking.\n\n● If \"The Dark Door\" is active, you can attack with another monster instead of this card. However, you must still attack with 1 monster.\n\n● If in defense position, having its effect negated, or summoned after the battle phase, the \"This card must attack if able\" clause does nothing this turn.\n\n● The effect to change battle position starts a chain when the attack is declared and can be negated by \"Divine Wrath\".\n\n● The effect to switch battle position can be chained to with cards like \"Mirror Force\". Even if the attacking monster is destroyed or otherwise prevented from reaching the damage step, the effect to switch battle position resolves normally.\n\n● If \"Book of Moon\" is Chained to the effect to change this card's battle position, it will change from face-down Defense Position to face-up Attack Position.",
