    "Tengu": "You can activate this card when your opponent declares an attack and if there is a monster(s) on your side of the field that includes Amazoness in its card name, or is named Amazon Archer. All monsters on your opponent's side of the field are changed to face-up Attack Position (Flip Effects are not activated), and as long as they remain face-up on the field, their ATK(s) are decreased by 500 points. Your opponent must attack with all of his/her monsters.\n●These monsters means all of your opponent's face-up monsters on the field at the time Amazoness Archers resolves, not just the monsters that were flipped by Amazoness Archers' effect.\n●If you activate Amazoness Archers during the Battle Phase and your opponent Special Summons another monster afterwards (such as with Call of the Haunted, or if Cyber Jar is flipped), the newly-Summoned monster is not affected by Amazoness Archers and does not suffer the -500 ATK reduction nor does it have to attack.\n●The -500 ATK applies to each monster as long as that monster remains face-up on the field. You can activate multiple Amazoness Archers and the ATK reductions are cumulative (so -1000 ATK with 2 copies).\n●Amazoness Archers vs. Cat's Ear Tribe: the ATK is 200.\n●If Fushioh Richie or Otohime are flipped face-up by Amazoness Archers' effect, their effects are activated because their effects are not Flip Effects; their effects begin a new chain that resolves after the current chain.\n●If a face-down Jinzo is flipped by Amazoness Archers, Amazoness Archers' effect is not negated.\n●The effect of Amazoness Archers will make your opponent have to attack with all of his monsters if he has multiple monsters on his side of the field. If Amazoness Archers is in effect, and later a replay occurs, your opponent cannot choose not to attack.\n●Monsters that have already attacked cannot attack again. If The Dark Door is active, your opponent still can only attack with 1 monster. Monsters which cannot attack still cannot attack (Toon Monsters the turn they are Summoned, Ultimate Obedient Fiend under the wrong conditions, etc.) If Diffusion Wave-Motion is in effect, only the monster affected by Diffusion Wave-Motion can attack. The ATK reduction of Amazoness Archers is still applied in these cases where monsters cannot attack.\n●If you activate Amazoness Archers and chain Magic Cylinder, Magic Cylinder does the full damage before the -500 ATK is applied; your opponent's other monsters must attack normally. If you chain Amazoness Archers to Magic Cylinder, the ATK is reduced first and then Magic Cylinder does damage.\n●If either player chains Negate Attack to Amazoness Archers, the Battle Phase ends because of Negate Attack's effect.",
