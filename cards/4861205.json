Player B chains with “Mystical Space Typhoon”. Would Player A still be able to summon a Zombie? What if “Call of the Mummy” is already face-up and ‘applying’. If I activate its effect to Special Summon, can I chain “Mystical Space Typhoon”? Also if I can chain “Mystical Space Typhoon”, will I then still be able to Special Summon the Zombie since the effect of Call of the Mummy is already is motion and on the chain block? \nA: Call of the Mummy is a Continuous Spell Card. It must remain on the field in order for its effect to resolve, so if it is destroyed by Mystical Space Typhoon no Zombie will be Special Summoned.",
