    "Tengu": "(1) If Necrovalley is on the field when this card declares an attack, you can change the battle position of 1 face-up monster your opponent controls.\n●The (1) optional Trigger Effect activates in Start of the Battle Phase - Attack Declaration.\n●This effect targets 1 face-up monster your opponent controls.\n●If the target is no longer face-up, its battle position is not changed.\n●The target can only be changed to face-up Defense Position. This effect does not Set the target.\n●This effect can be activated even if Necrovalley's effects are negated by Magic Deflector.\n●Necrovalley only needs to be face-up when this effect activates, not when it resolves.\n●VS. Spirit Reaper: When targeted by Assailant, Spirit Reaper is destroyed by its own effect. Then a replay occurs, as the number of attack targets changed before entering the Damage Step. In this case, Gravekeeper’s Assailant can attack again, and can activate its effect again.",

Then a replay occurs because the potential attack targets on the opponent's side of the field were changed. In this case, Gravekeeper’s Assailant can attack again, and can activate its effect again.\n●If Necrovalley is on the field, an attack is declared with Gravekeeper’s Assailant, and the effect of Gravekeeper’s Assailant is activated, and Mystical Space Typhoon is chained to the effect to destroy Necrovalley, the effect of Gravekeeper’s Assailant is still applied because Necrovalley only had to be on the field to activate the effect.",
