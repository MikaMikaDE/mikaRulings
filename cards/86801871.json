Player B plays “Change of Heart” on the Snake Token and attacks Player B's “Dream Clown”, destroying both monsters. Who would take the damage? \nA: When the “Poisonous Snake Token” is destroyed by battle the opponent of the person whom activated “Cobra Jar's” effect and created the token will take the damage. So even if the opponent had taken control of the “Snake Token” with “Change of Heart”, he/she would still receive the damage when the “Snake Token” is destroyed.",
