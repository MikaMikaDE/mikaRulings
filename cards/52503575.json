After flipping “Crass Clown” face-up, does it turn into Attack Position triggering its effect before being destroyed by the attack? \nA: Yes it would get its effect, but the effect will activate during the Resolve Monster Effects portion of the Damage Step, which is after damage calculation. \n●Q: Can the position of “Crass Clown” be manually changed to Defense Position while “Final Attack Orders” is applying on the field, changing back to Attack Position by the effect of “Final Attack Orders”, and thus activating the effect of “Crass Clown”? \nA: You cannot perform a manual change of position if the face-up monster is in Attack Position. You can still use card effects to change the face-up monster's position. \n●Q: Are Face Down Monsters that are attacked while “Final Attack Orders” is applying forced into Attack position?\nA: Any face-up monster or monster turned face-up by an attack or a card effect will have its battle position changed to attack position due to “Final Attack Order's” effect. This includes a monster flipped face-up during the Damage Step. So while a monster like “Goblin Attack Force”, “Giant Orc”, and “Spear Dragon” have effects that switch them to Defense Position after having attacked, the “Final Attack Orders” will then switch them to attack position after their effect resolves.",
