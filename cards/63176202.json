    "Tengu": "(U) If you control 2 or more Six Samurai monsters, you can Special Summon this card from your hand. (1) Your opponent can activate only 1 Spell/Trap Card each turn. (2) If this card would be destroyed, you can destroy a Six Samurai monster you control instead.\n●The (U) Unclassified Effect works like a built-in Special Summon. This Summon does not start a chain.\n●The (1) Continuous Effect applies so long as Great Shogun Shien is face-up on the field.\n●Your opponent can activate either 1 Spell Card or 1 Trap Card each turn; not one of each.\n●If the activation of your opponent’s Spell/Trap Card is negated (by “Dark Bribe), they can still activate 1 more Spell/Trap Card after that.\n●This effect applies during both players’ turns.\n●The effects of face-up Spell / Trap Cards can be activated without restriction.\n●The effects of Spell / Trap Cards in the GYs can be activated without restriction.\n●If your opponent activates a Spell / Trap Card, and later you Special Summon “Great Shogun Shien” (or flip him face-up), your opponent can activate 1 more Spell / Trap Card this turn.\n●The (2) Continuous Effect does not activate.\n●This effect does not target. You cannot destroy a face-down “Six Samurai” monster instead.\n●This effect applies while resolving the effect (ex: Call of the Haunted, Raigeki Break).\n●Your other “Six Samurai” monster is considered to be destroyed by this (your) effect.\n●Example: If “Ring of Destruction” targets a “Six Samurai” monster, and you destroy a different “Six Samurai” monster instead, zero damage will be inflicted by “Ring of Destruction”.\n●This effect can apply in Substep 4 - Damage Calculation. The substitute “Six Samurai” is sent to the GY in Substep 7 - End of the Damage Step, it is not treated as 'destroyed by battle'.\n●You cannot destroy 1 “Six Samurai” to save multiple other “Six Samurai” monsters at the same time.\n●Example: If Mirror Force would destroy 2 of your Six Samurai monsters, you must destroy 2 Defense Position Six Samurai monsters to save those two.\n●This effect cannot apply if the substitute “Six Samurai” is also being destroyed by the effect.\n●Example: If Mirror Force would destroy all your Six Samurai, you cannot substitute any.\n●If you control 2 “Six Samurai” monsters, and 1 of them equipped with “Legendary Ebon Steed” would be destroyed, the effect of “Legendary Ebon Steed” must be used. You cannot choose to destroy another “Six Samurai” monster instead.",
