After “Delinquent Duo” has resolved “Electric Snake” will activate. \n●Q: I saw a tournament where Player A plays “Delinquent Duo.” The card discarded was “Electric Snake.” Player B draws two cards. Player B then selects another “Electric Snake” that he just drew, to discard to the GY. Player B then draws two more cards. In another tournament, the players would finish “Deliquent Duo's” effect then draw the cards to electric snake effect. Which one is right? \nA: “Electric Snake's” effect does not resolve until “Delinquent Duo” is fully resolved. In other words, Player B cannot draw two cards for “Electric Snake's” effect until after “Delinquent Duo's” effect is over. They must discard a card that is already in their hand to finish “Delinquent Duo's” effect before they can actually draw for “Electric Snake.” Steve Okegawa, 12/14/2003\n●Q: If I play “Delinquent Duo” and I pick my opponents “Neko-Mane King”, does he still have to discard? \nA: Yes, they would still have to discard 1 more card from their hand according to the text of “Delinquent Duo.” After completely resolving “Delinquent Duo” the “Neko Mane King’s” effect will activate.",
