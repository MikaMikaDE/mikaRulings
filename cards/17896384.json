If that card's effect is negated (by Spell Canceller), Spell Counters cannot be placed on it and any Spell Counters already on it are removed.\n●The (2) Ignition-like Effect activates & resolves on the field.\n●Sending “Arcane Barrier” and a Spellcaster to the GY is a cost. This effect can't activate while Macro Cosmos is active, since you can't pay the cost.",
