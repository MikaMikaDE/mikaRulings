    "Base": "1. This card continuously targets the Synchro Monster.\\n2. If you take control of a Synchro Monster with \"Tuner's Scheme\" and then the monster is flipped face-down, you keep control of it, but it is no longer targeted by \"Tuner's Scheme\".\\n3. If your opponent uses \"Brain Control\" to take control of the monster you took control of with \"Tuner's Scheme\" and the monster is destroyed, \"Tuner's Scheme\" is destroyed as well.\\n4. If \"Tuner's Scheme\" is removed from the field, its effect no longer applies and your opponent regains control of the Synchro Monster."
