The ATK and DEF of “Gren Maju Da Eiza” will not change. The ATK and DEF of “Uria, Lord of Searing Flames” will not change. The ATK of “Arcanite Magician” will not change, even if the number of Spell Counters does.\n●If “Shrink” targets a monster that has been affected by “Inverse Universe” its ATK will be half of its original, printed ATK. After “Shrink” wears off, the monster’s ATK becomes its original, printed ATK.\n●If “Ojama Country” is switching the ATK and DEF of all monsters and “Inverse Universe” is played, the ATK and DEF values will be switched again. Even if “Ojama Country” leaves the field later, the values set by “Inverse Universe” will remain.\n●Monsters affected by “Inverse Universe” have their ATK and DEF switched for as long as they are face-up on the field.\n●You can activate “Inverse Universe” during the Damage Step, but not during damage calculation. If the ATK of a monster is being changed by an Equip Spell and “Inverse Universe” is activated, the ATK and DEF switch, but the Equip Spell does not reapply its effect to the new ATK.\n●When the Equip Spell is destroyed, the ATK and DEF of the monster do not change.\n●New Equip Spells will modify the new ATK.",
