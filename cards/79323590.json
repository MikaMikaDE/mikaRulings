A card is defined as played by either putting it on the field through normal means; for example, a Normal Summon/Set, Activating a Spell Card from the Hand, Setting a Spell/Trap Card, or activating a discarding effect like “Kuriboh” from the hand. \n●Cards Set previous to “Chain Energy” do not trigger the 500 LP cost.\n●Cards brought to the field through another effect, like Special Summoning a monster through “Monster Reborn” do not trigger the 500 LP cost of “Chain Energy”.\n●Q: If I have only 500 LP remaining with “Chain Energy” applying on the field, can I activate “Poison of the Old Man” to increase my LP before losing the 500 points from the effect of “Chain Energy” and losing the Duel? \nA: When you play the Poision of the Old Man Chain Energy will cause you to pay 500 LP, reducing your LP to 0 before Poison of the Old Man can resolve.",
