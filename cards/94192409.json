    "Goat": "●Compulsory Evacuation Device targets 1 monster.\n●You can return your opponent’s monster to his hand during the Battle Step of the Battle Phase with the effect of “Compulsory Evacuation Device”, but not the Damage Step of the Battle Phase.\n●If you bounce an attacking monster during the Battle Step with the effect of “Compulsory Evacuation Device”, it does not cause a replay.\n●If you bounce the defending monster with the effect of “Compulsory Evacuation Device”, it does trigger a replay. \n●Q: If “Skill Drain” is applying on the field, can you chain “Compulsory Evacuation Device” to the effect of a Flip Effect Monster when its Flip Summoned such as “Fiber Jar” or “Cyber Jar” and resolve their effects?\nA: Yes, you can chain Compusory Evacuation Device to the flip effect of Cyber Jar and Fiber Jar when you Flip Summon them. The Cyber Jar/Fiber Jar would return to your hand first, then its effect would resolve. Since it would not be face-up on the field when its effect resolves, Skill Drain will not negate it.",
