    "Goat": "●If “Fake Trap” is activated in a chain to “Nobleman of Extermination,” “Fake Gary Haynes, Trap” will destroy itself and “Nobleman of Extermination’s” effect will be negated. Other copies of “Fake Trap” will not be removed from play. Trap cards that are activated in a chain with “Nobleman of Extermination” will not be removed by the effect of “Nobleman of Extermination.” “Nobleman of Extermination’s” effect will disappear in this case.\n●Q: If “Fake Trap” is chained to “Nobleman of Extermination” would other cards of the same name still be removed from the game? \nA: No other traps would be removed. “Fake Trap” was not destroyed by the effect of “Nobleman of Extermination.” The effect of “Nobleman of Extermination” would disappear in this situation. \n● \n●Q: If the Trap Card targeted by “Nobleman of Extermination” is properly chained to “Nobleman of Extermination” (like “Waboku”), does it still get removed from play, and do like cards still get removed from play? \nA: If the selected Trap Card has not been activated AND Resolved when Nobleman of Extermination resolves, then Nobleman of Extermination will still be able to remove it, as well as all copies of the Trap Card in either player's decks. Waboku will be unaffected because it is not a Continuous card, and it has already resolved by the time Nobleman of Extermination resolves. This still results in Nobleman of Extermination's effect disappearing. ",
