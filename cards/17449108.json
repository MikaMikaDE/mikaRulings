If the card is a Trap Card, both players must check their respective Decks and remove all cards of the same name from play. Then shuffle the Decks.\n●The (1) effect targets a face-down Spell / Trap Card anywhere on the field.\n●You can target a face-down monster that is equipped to Relinquished.\n●If the target is not destroyed, it is not removed from play, nor are any cards in the Deck(s).\n●If the target is not face-down, it is not destroyed and no cards are removed from play.\n●If the target is destroyed, and it was a Trap Card, you and your opponent MUST briefly show each other your Decks to verify that all copies of that Trap Card have been removed.\n●This cannot take place using online duel simulators, as it allows opportunity for foul play.\n●VS. Imperial Iron Wall: Nobleman CANNOT be activated while IWW is active. If IWW is chained to Nobleman, the target is still destroyed but it is not removed from play, nor are any cards in the Deck(s).",
    "Goat": "●If “Fake Trap” is activated in a chain to “Nobleman of Extermination,” “Fake Gary Haynes, Trap” will destroy itself and “Nobleman of Extermination’s” effect will be negated. Other copies of “Fake Trap” will not be removed from play. Trap cards that are activated in a chain with “Nobleman of Extermination” will not be removed by the effect of “Nobleman of Extermination.” “Nobleman of Extermination’s” effect will disappear in this case.\n●Q: If “Fake Trap” is chained to “Nobleman of Extermination” would other cards of the same name still be removed from the game? \nA: No other traps would be removed. “Fake Trap” was not destroyed by the effect of “Nobleman of Extermination.” The effect of “Nobleman of Extermination” would disappear in this situation. \n● \n●Q: If the Trap Card targeted by “Nobleman of Extermination” is properly chained to “Nobleman of Extermination” (like “Waboku”), does it still get removed from play, and do like cards still get removed from play? \nA: If the selected Trap Card has not been activated AND Resolved when Nobleman of Extermination resolves, then Nobleman of Extermination will still be able to remove it, as well as all copies of the Trap Card in either player's decks. Waboku will be unaffected because it is not a Continuous card, and it has already resolved by the time Nobleman of Extermination resolves. This still results in Nobleman of Extermination's effect disappearing. ",
